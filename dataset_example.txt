As any haircut some people look amazing and other no so much.
I'm seriously laughing my butt off right now
Seems like a lot of work to scam someone out of 100 buck. 
That's what I thought, too. But, there are a lot of desperate people out there.  
Hey you.
It's 9 am but thanks :) Have a good day too
Oooooh.  France?
I hope to.  It's my birthday...
But I just lost the game üòï

I have a PhD in math and scored 43/58 (74%) on an SAT II math exam. I feel embarrassed.

Pineapple on pizza is fine imo.

Sunflower seeds kept my hands busy.  Wishing you strength.
I feel so sorry for girls in night clubs.
You think they don't enjoy it? There's a reason girls don't wear sweats to the club.
Ah yes, they enjoy it. The preferred excuse of sexual assaulters everywhere. 
Tell me something good about your day
I rolled a really shitty joint but got really stoned anyways 
Came home early from school to sleep before work. Best decision this past week. 
My birthday is tomorrow and tonight i cried.

For security purposes.
When is the last time you cried?
Right now in a grocery store parking lot :)
I've been on reddit for over 3 years now and it still baffles me how many times the same photo/video will get reposted and hit front page.
This is a repost
Everything is a repost if you dig far enough.
That's really deep dude
wait until you've been here 12 years ... (sorry, not many chances to brag)
Why do you have so little karma even after 12 years?
Hey r/CasualConversation! It's time to vote for the best of the best of 2018.

How often do you make new Reddit accounts?
&gt;How often do you change accounts?
Probably once every six weeks. For privacy.

What's your ultra secret second account?

That's a lame secret
ya sorry, im a lame person :(
Now I feel bad for calling your secret lame
I'm having a really awful day, what's your favourite way to make yourself feel better?
I usually watch a Ghibli movie.
Those do feel like a good hug. 
Casual bike ride. A non-excruciating exercise.
Is it sad that I can't actually ride a bike?? I appreciate your input tho! 
I listen to music and/or watch the movie the secret when I feel down
Queens GIANT hit Bohemian Rhapsody came out in 1977 and to this day is considered a banger. I wonder what current song will be still getting played in 41 years time that gets everyone as excited as Bohemian Rhapsody.
The Smashing Pumpkins will be still played in 50 years. 
I was going to say Hey Ya, but realized it's about 15 years old. Now I feel old.
i was gonna day Crazy by Gnarls Barkley but that came out around then too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I was going to say Never Going to Give You Up,  so get off my lawn.
I was gonna say Sweet Child O‚Äô Mine so get off MY LAWN. 
I hate to be That person, but it came out in 1975.
Google lied to me üòÇ
Not entirely. It was on an album in '77.
Which one?
I lied. Google might be a little slow, album was in '76. A Night At The Opera.
Feel Good Inc for sure
While I love feel good Inc, I think Clint Eastwood is more likely. 
Night Moves will never *not* get played on classic rock radio
Seven Nation Army, A Milli, Sandstorm, Clubbed to Death, Gangnam Style.
In the UK, Mr. Brightside will never die.
And take me out by franz ferdinand

Hope you feel better soon mate! 
As a dude who just tried 'leggings' on for the first time, where has this been my whole life?
Be careful about constricting your nads like that boss. It ain't good for them. 
You‚Äôve clearly never lived in the north in winter.
Long johns are love, long johns are life. 
I thought long johns was the universal term. This thread is telling me otherwise
Can i wear them as pants like some girls do?
Yeah but don't get mad when all the ladies are looking at your booty!
My dude i just got some this morning (i work overnight and outside sometimes). 
Hhnnnggggg
My crush confessed her feelings for me today! I can't be happier.
You are a beacon of hope to all of us
Hey guys, I'm kinda drunk. What's everyone doing tonight?
Drinking beer, playing BOTW, and snuggling my cat. Nice quiet evening. :)
Reddit in general, I love you guys.
Hi.  I liked reading your comment.  Thank you.  :)

Hey I'm basically in the same mental state as you are!  
##**There are dozens of us!**
Holy shit me and you are practically alike 
i'm sad, people of CasualConversation, tell me something good that happened to you today so i can steal other people's happiness &lt;3
I bought a pack starbursts out of a vending machine and got 2 packs instead
i'm most jealous of you out of everyone in this thread &lt;3
I got 8/8 on a quiz in chem, which i suck at but its great

How was your day today pal?
I just got my first kiss today guys!
16 isnt late for the first kiss at all imo
**Conservative muslim society**
Your point is...?
**Conservative girls = no kissing/hugging**
&gt;I'm 16 so i think this is a little late
You're kidding, right?

Give me a theme and I‚Äôll write you a short poem
A brave woman willingly becomes an alien to gain power to avenge her lover.
To give up her humanity,
To give up her life,
To change her anatomy,
To save her wife.
THANK YOU. This goes out to the people that reach out to their friends or family when they feel something is wrong.
I wish
What are the best tv theme songs?
The Muppet Show from the 70's/80's
Bojack horseman has an amazing intro song, The intro in general is great!
I think I watched one episode of that one. I'll have to give it another shot
Did ANYBODY have a good 2018?
DEFINITELY not me. Fuck this year. 
I totally feel you. We‚Äôll have a pact to make sure 2019 is the best that it can be 
Do we have A Plan? 
I honestly believe that everyone should spend atleast 10 minutes a day just listening to music and not doing anything else.
I do it every day
At night I lay in bed text my friend and listen to music until like 3-4am
What time do you get up? 
I've never felt so positive &amp; motivated to live my life to the fullest since crippling myself.
Thank you for my morning Joe. You definitely got me going.üòÅ Thanks for the share.
&gt;  Oh my giddy aunt
I must know where this idiom comes from; it's adorable.
When I was 11 I learned fluent English thanks to Minecraft
Bruh same.
That's pretty cool, man.
Ricky Martin learned English watching Mr. Rodger's neighborhood.
I don‚Äôt think I know who that is
Reddit, kindly fuck off with your redesign. Every day I'm clicking 'Opt-out of redesign' and you kindly forget
I use RES, which seems to keep it at bay.
RES works for me flawlessly too ..
It‚Äôs fucking awful. At least mobile hasn‚Äôt changed. 
I woke up to a 7.0 magnitude earthquake this morning

What are the best condiments that you should put on a Burger?
And they do mayo/siracha now too. That would be great on a burger.
That does sound pretty tasty! Yeah normal Sriracha seems a bit too strong for me
Fried egg is my hands Down favorite 
Not really a condiment but definitely peanut butter and/or marshmallows
Taco Bell is spreading here in the UK so I decided to see if the joke about it destroying your insides was true. Myth confirmed.
I'm sure it'll be the first of many! lol Taco Bell is great!
My bowls‚Äôre telling me no, but my tongue, my tongue is telling me yes. 
I still find it an exaggeration. I don't think I've ever had Taco Bell work as a laxative.
&lt;Laughs in Indian&gt;
have you tried KFC my friend?
Wait wait wait... How long has there been Taco Bell in the UK?? 
What movies do you have to stop and watch when flipping through channels?
Pearl Habour
Armageddon
Like seriously stupid but guilty pleasures.
The sound track alone is worth a watch! I agree those are great. :-)
I always stop to watch Good Will Hunting. 
That is one that I always mean to watch someday. I do love Robin Williams.
Y'all ever like a post or comment solely to make it even? Like, 599 to 600?
YES!!!!
I always do that, it makes you feel organized.
Hmm, what happens when someone got to 600 first? Your comment would be the 601. 
If it‚Äôs at 665, I have to.
mine is like lawful good and yours chaotic good lol

I upvoted this from 29 to 30 just for you.
thank you for your service üôè
I do the opposite. I like to upvote to make it odd-numbered...
* gasp * dear neptune...
ok WHOM keeps downvoting so that it goes back to the 69?? 
u trynna torture me or sum???
Will always and forever upvote 68. Always. 
Although I am a bit conflicted, I gotta: 69 --&gt; 70
I do it every time I see something or someone with a 666 karma. I‚Äôm superstitious, I guess. 
saw this post had 99 comments.
Only if it's at 618
aaaa I don't know this reference. *googles it furiously*
All. The. Time.
I have also felt trapped when I couldn't upvote something because it was at 69.
Now I want to follow all of OPs comments and make them uneven 
One of My Hobbies is Collecting &amp; Organizing Useful Websites. Please Help Me Indulge. What Are Your Favorites?
Radioooooo.com
Lol nice try Buzzfeed! 
Marking for later.
Does anyone else use fairly uncommon words during a conversation (e.g. pertinent) and immediately second guess if you are actually using that word correctly?
It's cool using ubiquitous
Like Michael Scott?
Can I hear that used in a sentence please?
I‚Äôm sat in a pub alone after being stood up by four friends and I want to talk to someone so I buy a lemonade instead of another beer.
Hello!!!!
If they got some good fried chicken or chips go for it
Are you using chips in the British sense, or the American one? 
Have you ever had peach lemonade!?
I'm adopting two cats tomorrow!!!
Don‚Äôt keep loose ribbon or string around.   They‚Äôll eat it. 
Learned this the hard way.  
Oops. I'll be careful about that! 
Also plastic! Mine love plastic. And bottle caps are their favorite toys. I have weird cats. 
Don‚Äôt let them eat floss or they will need a 3 grand surgery.
To the girl in the community college cafeteria, I totally just saw you hit yourself in the face and laugh.
Lure her with baked goods. You got dis.
I‚Äôm having a hard time picturing why/how a phone would be caught on something

My boyfriend is helping my mom make mashed potatoes for me right now.
He's not just a boyfriend. That's a *partner* üòç

This is so wholesome. Where can I get a boyfriend like that?
Sigh....
Who/what do you come here for?

Actually, I don't really know.

What‚Äôs your sport?
Remember when you were young? 
You shone like the sun 
Did you find your friend?
What's your weird hobby?
What about asking random people on the internet questions? That counts, right? üòÅ
I've got something for you.
Hey friend :)
What do I get? 
I love when people reply to a comment I write or a post I make. It makes me feel like I have a community.
Comment and I'll compliment you, or say something supportive :)
No, of course not! How are you? :3
Met up with a Redditor for a beer. Didn't get raped or murdered. Win.
Yeah man, it was a good time. Way too much calamari though. 
&gt; Way too much calamari though.
Omg did you actually finish that after?! Oy.
Is this the actual redditor? This story is awesome!
Struggling with quitting addictions
Hi lol
Hows your day 
Weird. How was your day? 
The best part of my day was having a coffee in the morning. My days been slow 
What did you do today?
Introspected 
Can to share a thought?
You wake up one day and you are the opposite gender. What are some of the first things you will do?
Play with my boobs obviously
What if your new body doesn‚Äôt have any?
Get brest implants and play with them ;)
What if your new body is poor? 
See what the big fuss about jerking off is.
It‚Äôs not so much about jerking off as it is about going 12 hours without doing it
Well magic exists. So I guess I'd start going to church. 
Warn tf out of my parents and call in sick at school
Go pee. No matter what sex you wake up as your going to use the bathroom. 
Pee standing up. That's what I would do.
Find out if women can really suck on their own nipples 
Panic a lot. Then masturbate.
Talk to my ex so she will be able to love me again.
Try to get a blowjob from my wife and then penetrate her with my now real dick
Lift up my shirt in disbelief.
Probably be very happy.
r/egg_irl
Google the nearest lesbian bar. 
I‚Äôll answer your question with a question - how big are my boobs?
(I‚Äôm a male)
My boyfriend's mom likes me and it makes me really happy
Aww, that‚Äôs nice! 
As they say, keep your friends close and your enemies closer... 
oh god oh f**k oh no
This is the internet, you can swear. 
I hope you like your xmas present.... *dagger to the liver*
one can only hope
Back when I was 15 I would go to my ex's house just to play risk with her father
What did she get you?
idk it‚Äôs not christmas yet 
Hey Reddit, how's life?
Life is looking up grandma. 
Ahahaha I'm 26.... Just old at heart
Go dancing or play bingo then 
If they are my only options, can I not just be kidnapped and murdered?
Proud of you for getting things done today
Playing guitar
Some of the most well known songs are based around 2 or 3 chords just saying. 
I‚Äôm so bored! Tell me about yourself
I'm only human. 
That‚Äôs exactly what a robot would say 
Oh no, my secret is out. 
Gotcha! 
We're still on track to take over the world soon though... 
Question for everyone
That's just a thing some people do. It happens to me pretty frequently.
Would you say consistently, like always phasing out of one into another?
All the time. Some interests stick around but I fall out of love with new things as well.
Nice! Glad there are more of us out there
To the dude in GameStop, you are amazing.
Glad to hear a nice black friday story for a change! 
It truly is, but if you always want a nice black friday story; stay home with your family. 
That‚Äôs why I have rule that I don‚Äôt leave home on Black Friday 
I have the same rule during the Purge
Then how do you kill your neighbors and take their flatscreen?
Kindness exists. 
I hope that guy  found what game he was looking for :) 
I do too!

Dude. 
I love gloomy weather.
Not me. I love the sunshine. Golden warm, just enough to make your skin glow.
I am going to ask you questions.
i‚Äôm up for it, hit me
When you jump onto reddit what are you really hoping to find?
To be very honest, quality memes is what im after.
Ask me one question
ask me what is my favorite colour  :D
What if I don't? 
Then you will never know  :P
Ask me a question.
Would you rather be right or prove someone else wrong?
Throw something at me
Hit me with a question, please
Hit it! I‚Äôm down to answer üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Why don‚Äôt we call people with masters degree ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù
I‚Äôd never call anybody master 
Why not? If they‚Äôre women we‚Äôll call them Missy.
I'm called Bachelor Dude, wasn't the same when I was in a relationship but now it fits fine.
#Master Ben Shapiro
Ugh
Secondary question, why isn‚Äôt it called a Masterate, as in Doctorate 
In some languages it is i.e in Portuguese they are called Mestrado and Doutorado respectively. 
I think that's the case in all Romance/Latin languages.
I could see black people having an issue with calling someone ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù.
Master is the title of young unwed boys already
People with PhD‚Äôs aren‚Äôt real doctors 
My PhD diploma says otherwise..
I have my masters and I absolutely wish this were true 
Question for Americans: Do people go inside homes and apartments with shoes on?
It is the norm to come in with shoes. 
Alright, do you feel that it is annoying when people don't want you to come in with shoes?
i feel it's disrespectful and they are full of sh. like it's just a floor. 
Hahaha, if you did it here people would think you're crazy
I just successfully defended my PhD thesis!
Congratulations, Doctor!  You'll have to change your username now....!
Thanks! I'll keep the username, though. Never stop learning!
Dr. Master4pprentice
What does your username mean?
Movie line. 
i think mine's pretty self explanatory
English as second language speakers - stop apologizing for your English!
Is your mom from Asia?

That kindda threw me off too
Question, where you on fire when she said that? 
Aww I'm really happy for you dude! I hope you have a great second date
Congrats, bathe in it as complements are a rare thing for us guys. 
Dude! Ifkr, I can count the number of compliments I've received over the past year
me too: zero
Just had a creepy browse of your post history and I must admit... you're pretty hot OP
U sexy 
I wanna talk about anything
what‚Äôs your favorite activity in the world? 
Playing video games or watching anime

No, but I've heard it's really good
Do you ever hear the phrase: Way to go, Idado!?
What‚Äôs your favourite video game of all time?
Sleeping dogs or bully
I gave a guy CPR today
Did you perform the compressions to Stayin Alive?
Haha I did actually
Seriously I would have too
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Wow so hows being gay
Did you hear his ribs crack? Or is that a myth?
It‚Äôs a thing.  
Eek! OK thanks for confirming. 
Did anyone clap their hands afterwards? 
(No sarcasm) 
A redditor fed me.

Tomorrow I‚Äôll be 30 days sober.
Great work! Keep going!
Don‚Äôt forget to put lettuce on sandwiches!
Chips are a fun alternative for this.
oh man . Is it one or the other or can you do both ?
I like to use baby spinach! Lettuce is good every now and then too though
idk.. lettuce depends on my mood tbh. i'd rather broccoli
ü•¶ I dislike the brocc
I'm falling in love with my wife all over again
This, fellas, is how marriage is supposed to be...
So you're divorced too? Lol.
Welp, I‚Äôm in tears. This is so beautiful. Congratulations to you both. ‚ù§Ô∏è
She knows your Reddit account, doesn't she?
Maybe try talking to her instead of karmawhoring
My wife an I have hall sex.

Happy Late Cake day to you and /u/UnstableBork !!!
Happy cake day!! I think it might be my cake day too?
Also, what is cake day? Is it your birthday? (Sorry, I'm sort of new to Reddit)
It‚Äôs still your cake day for me bro
Happy Cakeday friend!!
Why are you so quiet?
Best Answer:
Why are you so loud?
Some folk will just never understand.
My chemistry professor almost made me cry this morning.
You have to slay a few dragons to get your queen.
I‚Äôd prefer a king tbh.
sup?
I prefer the dragon.
Is this a Game of Thrones reference?
I hope not. I actually thought it was a shrek reference...
You got a line of people tryna date you now.
My biggest turnon is when a girl says her parents are dead
Uh what?
Glad I never went to college.
Why‚Äôs that?
I got stood up for a date today, and I'm not even mad.
If I was the girl, I‚Äôd probably just be asleep rather than intentionally stand you up
My daughter saw a commercial for the first time today and didn't understand what was going on.

I thought Hulu had ads that you paid for.
The no ads plan is a little more
Do you have to play for Plex? It seems interesting.  Also doesn't Hulu have ads now?
Mine was $70 for lifetime
That really isn't bad at all.  I might have to look into it
hulu has ads. p sure this fake bruv
I just rubbed my very anxious BF back for 20 mins to help him finally fall asleep.
I always feel like some ancient Greek goddess of sleep when I get to help like this. Good job!
You are literally the best kind of person. Thank you for being you.
I remember ,once i had to keep my hand still for the whole night as she had slept on my arm !
/r/feelingsillneverknow
But, good for you two &lt;3

She's probably a lesbian
I must converse with humans on the internet.
Hello, fellow human.
I'm doing great, actually. Just chilling here at home listening to some music
Lol me too. What are you listening to?
Hello how is your day going today?
Pretty good. Hbu?
I'm doing pretty good can't really complain.
What do you want to talk about?
I'm open to talk about anything.

Hobbies, goals in life, (and if you are under 16;) career hopes.
Let's go with hobbies.

Great job! What is your new degree in?
Cybersecurity
Wow that's awesome! Definitely a field with lots of job opportunity I would imagine
Awesome! There have been literally 7 total 4.0s in the history of my school lmao
Wow, what school do you attend (if you're comfortable to share)?
I‚Äôm proposing tonight!!
Let us know how it goes. I was lucky. My wife proposed to me first :P
That‚Äôd be pretty nice lol. Thanks for the kind words!!
It's been 10 hours, did you do it or is it not time yet?
Good luck, you probably already did, I hope it went well!
It did!!!!
Yayyy!! Congratulations! üéâ

I‚Äôm scrunching up my face just reading this.
I was recently told that the man I donated stem cells to has made a full recovery from leukemia.
That‚Äôs awesome. High five for a good human moment

Can you sell stem cells
Going to see my first ever client as a psychologist tomorrow !!!

How does that make you feel?
Damn, im really debating if i should give you my only silver i have.
Congratulations. Pop by r/therapists and fill us in on how it goes for you.
Can I talk to you?
I quit smoking thanks to my GF.
No relationship is better than weed imho.
Weed can't suck your dick.
Relationship does not suck your dick either.
Guns don't kill people, men or women suck your dick.
If you had $20000 and no responsibilities what would you do?
i would buy a tesla
I find it interesting how on reddit, where everything is anonymous, people tend to be much more polite, well spoken, and decent than on social media such as facebook or instagram, where all of your personal information is shared with everyone.
well couldn‚Äôt agree more
Anyone else think they were raised by the internet?
On the contrary, my friend. I helped raise the internet.

Cows got my roommate on Reddit
Sounds like he found his happy place. I'm glad.
[goes to look up cows]
I‚Äôm not sure... he just typed in ‚Äúcows.‚Äù üòÇ
You didn't reply to the comment üòâ
As a guy who is relatively new to having long hair, there's one thing about it that has truly changed me as a person.
pulling hairs out from your butt in the shower is definitely one to look forward to
Not in the shower, but *doing other things*, if you know what I mean. :,(
im screaming
For the past decade, I thought I was the problem in my relationships. Turns out I wasn't.
Relatable.
Same. I need to find my own G
Reading this put a smile on my face. Thank you for the wholesome story OP, glad you're happy!
Thank you! Glad it put a smile on your face :)
100% relatable. I'm so happy for you btw :)
Anyone else tired of the 9-5 corporate rat race?
Wait, you get to go in at 9 and leave at 5?
Plus 1 hour of unpaid lunch. So it is actual 9-6 for a bare minimum wage.
Me (20M) and my gf (20F) just got a call -- we were approved for our new apartment!
Save as much as you can because furniture and all the basics you need add up.
For sure! Planning on getting a few cheap things from Goodwill and upgrading as we go :)

What kind of disabilities does your nonprofit work with?
People with developmental disabilities
My friend showed exactly what kind of friend she is.
You should let her know how much you appreciate her friendship!
With your dick
This took a very positive turn that I did not expect
OP had us in the first half
not gonna lie
OP

Thought this would be about how your friend disappointed you, glad it wasn‚Äôt.
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
Your parents would have shown up first
When do you fuck?
That's gonna be a big ol fuck no, she's very pretty but I have a girlfriend
What's bothering you today?
My girlfriend and I broke up
Having bad teeth doesn't make you a bad person
I'm not ashamed.  I'm just broke lmao
I get that. I'm sorry lol
lol, last time I saw the dentist was in middle school, so something like 17 years ago
Get a cleaning, nerd!!
Last time I went to the dentist they made me feel so embarrassed and I left in tears.....
I just remembered I forgot to brush my teeth this morning. Better go do that.
You say that, until y‚Äôall accuse me of never flossing and proceed to give me three fillings
Floss more and you won't been fillings
Not a bad person but freaking careless about basic hygiene which makes you a bum.
Not a bad person, just gross.
I got a heart on my starbucks cup
I‚Äôm glad it made you smile but these comments reminded me why you can‚Äôt do anything nice.
Omg I always get a smiley, never knew they only did it at nice people
I got excited until I figured out this isn‚Äôt a love story and you don‚Äôt get the man‚Äôs number
The sequel to Now You See Me wasn't called Now You Don't.
I‚Äôm so glad other people are still upset about this too.
I have come to terms with a lot of things over the years, this is not one of them.
Not us
Now 2 See Me: 2 Fast 2 Magical.
If there‚Äôs a third one it should be called Now You Three Me
No, it'll be Now you see me, as well
Now you see me too
Now, you! See me.
What were three good things about today?
1.I watched Game of Thrones.

Does anyone have dreams so surreal and lucid, leaves you a feeling of nostalgia and sort of depression for the rest of the day?
does this happen to you u/lerfer
i have a really sad dream and wake up weird but not the whole day
do you always remember the full dream or just remember that it was really sad
usually remember a lot of it
Yes.my sleeping pills cause them
Reddit can go from super wholesome to fucking toxic in no time!
It's a symptom of humanity
I‚Äôm a fat woman
Hi I like fat women, and there is nothing wrong with that. You be you
Obesity *is* unhealthy, however.
To the person I sat next to in Endgame (no spoilers)
Should have gotten that number!!
Next time!
So many regrets :-(
Is this a possible romance regret? Cause that's so cute.
Guy I sat next to was Michael, shout out to Michael. You're the man.
Make a post on Craigslist under Missed Connections. It‚Äôs worth a shot.
Hey, maybe you'll meet again sometime!. Then ask for his numberüëπ that was fate dammit
Post is spoiler free :)
You, mr mod, are bisexual now
I'm kinda bored and I wanna talk to someone.
my kinda hand hurts too
It suuucks.
I dont care a lick about the end game thingy, so if you have a risky click tag me in the comments and I'll let you know if its safe.
Kind of like the royal food testers of old, but without the risk.
Exactly!
I‚Äôll help. Tag me as well. Saw it tonight but had some asshole spoil it for me yesterday.
Iron Man dies at the end
I disagree with your premise entirely.
My husband gives me his pillow every morning
This is the cutest fucking thing Ive ever read. I hope my future husband is even half as sweet.
I have been a long time lurker on reddit and if im lucky i will hit 100 karma today. What small things made your day a little better?
My friend gave me a free ticket to go see Endgame with him tonight.
I don't get to see it til sunday :( 
But have fun!

We're going for high scores, right? I need to up my burger intake.
Where did you calculate that? Can't find the link in this thread.
I unsubscribed from all the main subreddits of this website - especially the news and politics subreddits - and the world is already a brighter place just a few days later
Sounds like you just want to live in an echo chamber.
Free Subscriptions
Oh fuck thanks I have to cancel Minecraft realms
Uhh not after that new update you don‚Äôt
What is it free now or something?
I always set reminders on the phone.
I sadly learned this lesson with a $99 app.
Ugh, only if i saw this yesterday D:
I'm guessing there is a story behind this... so how much did you end up paying?
*hits blunt*
Aren't we all subscribed to life
.. It's costing us everyday.
so... I found a hamster in my room!
Ever watch the secret life of pets?
I saw two of my friends in our social circle kiss each other in a club.
Nice work mate......
Did you have a crush on Her, too?
Such a good post
Friendship!!
Now you have to pick between the two of them when they break up.
I need a friend like you. That's so wholesome. Want to grab a beer in Toronto? üòÇ
I can only dream that all friendship groups are as supportive and cute as yours üòÅ
hobbies?
I love making graphics designs and animations . Especially for other people‚Äôs Youtube or Twitch.
nice man, always a consumer for that sorta thing :) how long you been doing that?
Reddit has completely ruined all other social media for me
That's when you tell your friends that you... *reddit* already üëâüòéüëâ
Lets discuss our favorite games of all time
Okami, oblivion, or Fe I think are my top three.
My husband has never had a peanut butter and jam sandwich, and frankly I SHOCKED!
How is that possible
Right? He blames his mother.
How so
She nevee made him one? She's weird. She used to peel the cheese off his pizza. Yea? What?
WTF, even so he could make one on his own
He's a simple man
Have you made him one yet?
Not yet. I told him we should go to the store to buy stuff but he just stared at me silently.
You should surprise him with a sandwich
It wouldn't be a surprise at this point.
Ah true
I'm 18 and haven't had it either, granted a peanut allergy may be a valid reason not to lol
Anyone wanna fall in love? - a personal social experiment
Okay sure.
Sometimes I forget I can just do stuff if I want.
i feel like this man just wanted to flex on us lmao
Important question on your edit.  Keto brownie mix? Share linky plz.
An Insanely Introverted Newbie Approaches :3
A good evening from here!
Evening you say, where in the world are you
From Australia. you?
California
Oooo. American timezones always mess me up xD
Well it's 545 am pst
Dang, you get up early. Or I just get up late lol
LoL, I'm up early because of work
That makes sense. What do you do for work if you don't mind me asking?
Due to a non disclosure agreement, I can't say
Oh okay. Mysterious..
For an introvert who can't make conversation, you sure say a lot. So well done.
What‚Äôs something you just LOVE the smell of that people would think is weird?
Burnt matches.
Mmmm
Oh absolutely! Especially when it‚Äôs first lit
My husband is a sleep talker
That's still a better script than Batman v. Superman
Aquaman 2‚Äôs looking good already
Have some random mod platinum!
How can you afford so many.
I love this so much! Please let us know when there are more!
What a ride!! 7/5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è

Be very worried when he stops talking and just smiles.
It makes me happy when, even in the most aggressive Reddit debates, neither person downvotes the other
Are u a heavy equipment operator? Ur username makes me think so
What, realistically, is the best thing that could happen to you today?
My children could be perfect angels today.
That would be pretty great! How likely is it to happen?
Well, so far they have been demon spawn today, but it's still early? I give it a 2% chance.
I am rooting for you and your kids :)
Thanks! Best of luck to you. I hope you get the job.
I could figure out what is causing all this pain I'm having
Physical pain?
Meet the love of my life.
somebody would call me to say they want to hang out whilst the weather is nice
Are you in the UK? I'm heading out into the nice weather soon :)
One thing I realized about myself is that the littlest things make me happy
For me it‚Äôs finding a pen that just writes so smoothly and fits in your hand perfectly.
Well do I have some news for you
I just got some mint soap.and I love it. Super cool smell for a soap
What colour is the number 5 to you?
green
Can you think of a reason why or are you like me and have no clue?

So proud of you ! You are the reason teachers like me wake up in the morning !
Oh thanks so much! :)
I went to uni at 26 and became a straight A all the way! Best time of my life!
That's great to hear. Good job!
Every single day for the past few weeks, a lizard has come into my backyard and done push-ups for literal hours straight. When I wake up to eat breakfast, I see him out there doing push-ups. When I eat dinner at night, he's still there. I think I'm going to get my ass kicked by a lizard.
Get him a lady lizard to distract him from beating your ass
Bagels are SO GOOD! What's your wake-up food?
This is my go-to breakfast food and waffles somedays.
Yesssss both are so good, but so unhealthy haha
any good songs or artists that you guys recommend?
Like rap at all? If so, I can send a couple songs your way.
Do you ever randomly catch a whiff of a specific smell and immediately think hey, that's the way it smelled in the spring of 2001 when I was playing Pokemon at my grandma's house
I only played pokemon at my grandma's in the spring of 1997, sorry.
Yes this has been especially vivid lately as this is a rough time of year for me.
Me every time I smell jasmine flowers
NO-my grandma died in 1986. I never played Pok√©mon. I was already married in 2001.
My mean cat is finally accepting me
It can, and will, retract its love, without reason or notice.
Just likes your room tbh
People think I‚Äôm crazy for deleting Facebook account, when actually I deleted my Facebook to avoid crazy people.
There is something fulfilling about using your current employer's internet to search for a new job.
Out of curiosity, what's your job OP?
Child Welfare Case Manager.
I'm 23 and still have no clue what to do in life.
Same. Want to talk about it? I don't have anything else to do üôÉ
Anyone else prefer the cold?

My fianc√© is writing a book and she just told me that the main character is based on me.
She's a keeper
I want this book.
Me too. I'll let you know when it's published. Might not be for a bit tho
It's been 6 hours. Is it done *yet*?!
No I'm sorry
I hope you didn't take me seriously, I was definitely just being funny :)
I know. I'm just weird and can't understand sarcasm sometimes.
Today I‚Äôve decided to upvote more posts instead of just lurking and smiling to myself
I makes your thumbs stronger!
You know what, me too, here‚Äôs my upvote :)

I‚Äôve up-caked your, ‚ÄúHappy cake day.‚Äù

I‚Äôd be like ‚Äú...what??‚Äù
It responds like:
Hey I'm sorry to bother you, can I come inside? I really need your help.
I know that some people get sad when they get downvoted for no reason so I spend a lot of my time on Reddit upvoting comments that don't deserve to be downvoted.
Me too!! And if someone comments on my post or comment, automatic upvote.
Also, boop have an upvote! :)
Ditto!
You guys are cute. Upvotes for both of y'all
And one for you, my friendo!

If this thread blows up....., why am I howling like such a child?
Best

Gonna search for a closet for me too
It will be a blast
He's found out we fart, kill him immediately
Stop lying. We all know women don't fart.
I‚Äôm pretty sure we fart butterflies and poop rainbows.
You store your cleaners in a closet?! Don‚Äôt they have families to go home to?
I‚Äôm colorblind and I tried EnChroma glasses today! I literally screamed.

Yes because I‚Äôve never been complimented before.

I'm a Jamaican who wonders what people outside of Jamaica thinks about Jamaicans.

I would never assume all Jamaicans bob sled but I got a question for you.
Rastas, chill &amp; cool black people, and jamaican pie!

You men sure get unnerved when you see a woman cry!
I think most people get anxious when they see another human being cry in public. 
Especially at work where you‚Äôre mostly just acquaintances
Are we not all humans?
real men dont like seeing women hurt :( 
r/gatekeeping
How do women act when they see a man crying?
Do you think that you could stand up right now and run a 5k?

Trapped in an elevator with 15% battery.

Nope. Not yet.

Party in a elevator 
Iron man in the endgame trailer

My boyfriend and I have a snapchat streak of 1,352 as of 4/1/19
Lucky all my friends have lost mine multiple times üò¢
I thought Snapchat died with the redesign a year or two ago
I don‚Äôt know anyone who doesn‚Äôt use snapchat 
Under 50 and I don't use it. I just don't have a life outside of work and the wife and kid.
Your wife could snap you pics of your kid while you‚Äôre at work :)
I don't even use Snapchat, but out of curiosity, can you clarify what a Streak is?

I just learned that for the past year, my girlfriend has been paying ¬£50 extra rent on my behalf without me knowing.
That‚Äôs really sweet. 
I asked her about it and she just went well, you needed help
When you proposing to her hahaha
Does she have a green shirt and big gloves? Because she sounds like a keeper.
Ponytail and a moustache? Sounds like a Seaman lover!
If she likes using her legs, de gea-m! She's a keeper
Keep her and better not hurt or imma after your arse man
you have very good friends . since you pay in euro's are you from England or not ?
Thats the symbol for the British pound sterling
How do you pronounce the letter Z? Is it *zed* or *zee*? Lets settle this argument once an for all!
People say zed?‚Äô! Im the zee side for sure
Zed because I'm British.
I'm going to be sitting in this airport terminal for 32 hours.
I'm game, 32 hours is a long time. Where you flying?
Without going to sleep!? 
What is the correct order to get dressed?
For me it's pants, shirt, bottoms, socks. Sometimes socks before shirt though.
Am I the only one who puts the top half on first wut 
My butt gets cold
No way same high five! 
üôå
Butt... butt five? 
Underwear, bra, socks, top, jeans, sweater
Why do you put socks on so early I don‚Äôt understand ahhh! It feels so weird 
I just hate feet in general. I like socks but only when put on last
Interviewed someone that claimed to have done my job, at my former employer, when I worked there nine years ago
How do folks think they can fake IT work?

Japanese toilets should be a basic human right
Doesn't that mean your butt is wet when you leave? Isn't that mildly uncomfortable? 
No no, you just wipe once to dry your butt and then you‚Äôre good to go.
I'm hoping toilet san II will blow dry me instead. No offence to toilet san I
There is a dryer function on many models of toilet-San.  
I've never found it to be very effective tho.

Job interview today, potentialy leaving a career I‚Äôve been in for almost 9 years.
Yeah I'm here. Except my situation is much more fragmented and fucked up.
Oh no that sucks! How come?
They say your late teens are the best time of your life. Actually I think 25 and upwards is the best. That's when you stop leading life to impress or please, and actually start doing things because you want to.
Nobody says teens are the best years
I‚Äôm sure some people do
Im 25, about to be 26 in a couple months, and I'm still a total train wreck. 
My people.
Ayyye. 25 year-old existential crisis gang. üëåüèº ha ha ha ha haohgodpleasemakethepainstopha ha ha.
I'm 26 and I can't do what I want because I don't have money.   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

I'm 27 and I've never been more miserable in my life.
Rejoice! 
I turn 25 tomorrow. Thank you for this. 
I‚Äôm 18 in two days!!!!!
Who in the fuck says your teens are the best?
It's my 25th birthday. Thanks for this. :-)
I‚Äôve given myself one year to get my shit together.
I hear you man. I hope you achieve it. I have been doing the same thing for ten years.
What are you doing? 
Y'all remember when there was gum stuck on everything?
It is you that has changed. You're no longer in the places where the gum is stuck. 
I'm afraid I'm a boring person.
Cultivate curiosity, ask questions. 
I will next time, thank you!
Tell me something good that happened to you today!
I'm drunk, does that count?
I met my Middle School best friend after 10 years of no sign of life. 
So cool! Did you just pick up where things left off or was there any kind of awkwardness? 
I wrote about it just now; feel free to check my profile. 
The girl at the Dubai Airport, hope you‚Äôre okay
To be fair, the Dubai airport almost brought me to tears several times during my time there...
Maybe you were both crying because the ice cream machine was down.
Why is everyone crying at the mcdonalds
As a guy, I wish I could do this. I always want to.
Can anyone wish me a happy birthday?
HAAAPPPY BIRTHDAAYYY MY DUDE &lt;3 
Kid next to me on this flight is unfamiliar with the concept of a remote.
How old was this kid? If it‚Äôs a teen, then I truly have lost hope for my generation.
No no no. That would shock my to my core no he's probably 4 or 5. 
Wait, they have remotes on planes? 
You ok there bud?
Ugh I hate kids like this. They make my generation look bad
Want to chat about something random?
How do you deal with self doubt? 
I'm willing to talk about anything so just start chatting away.
I'm doing very well thanks.
This lady smiles at me after a year and it felt really nice.
What race are you?
Take like a minute before answering this.
i feel like dogshit
Ahh, why is that?
oh it's just a usual thing
I don't feel much of anything to be honest with you.
Life is a huge (and not really funny) joke. 
Other than that, I'm doing okay. 
I want to learn more about you!

You sound like me nine years ago.
Do you still live there?
Go to Ebisu, and go drifting. Just a thought...
On what fucking road in Ebisu do you imagine people drift? Seriously, I'd like to know.
Public ones, at 2am
I drive the public roads in Ebisu at 2 a.m. Could you be more specific, please?
There is a circuit as well, with quite a popular jump drift.
In Ebisu?
Still waiting to hear which public streets in Ebisu.
Dude. You're 31 and just starting eikaiwa? See you at the HUB!
The HUB?
-Never been to japan.

Fucking LOL. 
I try not to talk to women
Why do you think that they may interpret what you are doing in that way
Idk, but I see it happen a lot.

Hmm I know what I'll be sending you for Easter now.
More chicken nuggets?  Yes, please!  :-)
Hope you like McDonald's!

Sweet chinese lady who took my order corrected it to ‚Äúno meat‚Äù because she saw my ashes
What are ashes
Ash Wednesday 
TIL: I'm today
congrat
thank
Ash Wednesday
Raised Eastern Orthodox (now Atheist), never ever heard of it until now.
dang, I was raised catholic and wouldn't even think twice about serving you beef haha
I thought about that too! I wouldn't try to correct someone's order, but Im glad she did.
What?? Ashes? We're you carrying an urn? Can you not eat meat after a funeral? 
Cheese in wantons? 
Mi√©rcoles de ceniza?
Wouldn‚Äôt want to eat beef and go to hell
Literally 
Ashes...? 
When God sends reminders.
That's nice! I got my ashes yesterday,IT WAS PACKED!
My grade went up and I almost have all ‚ÄúA‚Äù‚Äôs
That's awesome!!
Congratulations! It's always good to hear someone turn their grades around. 
I turned my grades around this semester too. I was doing so well but now I'm doing terrible. 
Wow that‚Äôs awesome! Spanish was difficult for me as well.
I‚Äôve just cooked my first ever meal, context and a story below
You can also eat toast raw if you need to.
I texted my husband after my afternoon hike to see if he wanted Chipotle. He called me right after he got my text to let me know he was already in the parking lot and was just about to call and see if I wanted anything. So we ended up just meeting at Chipotle and eating together. It was nice.
I read this on the way to Chipotle! 
It‚Äôs perfect for when I‚Äôve blasted through 600 calories in two hours! 
I have a sudden interest in hiking...
I love wholesome content üåü
This is adorable, I'm happy you're happy.
I can only hope to have this one day. :)
You should post this on r/PointlessStories
My boyfriend came over a little drunk after a night out with his coworkers
Wholesome , now if you excuse me , I need to go cry in the corner all alone.
Is there room for me too? 
Ask if there is room in that corner for me too.
I guess we aren't alone after all üñ§
If he says it while he's drunk you know it's real XD
hahahaha ur welcome for the karma babe :)
A bot just wished me happy cakeday and it made me smile for the first time in a week.

Happy cake day and remember everything will get better &lt;3
Brother 
I love meeting a fellow Joey. We should start a club tbh. 
I was about to create a subreddit but you can't do that via the rif-app. 
We'll have our subreddit in spirit. Just you, me, and all the others Joeys out there 
Stop what you‚Äôre doing and take a minute to appreciate being able to breathe freely through your non-congested nasal passages.
Nope I have a cold
Joke's on OP
Why are you on reddit right now?
9:09am I‚Äôm just putting off cleaning my room tbh
Want to clean my room after you clean yours? üò¨
How‚Äôs it going?
My day sucked but not shocking because my entire week sucked 
Oh no! What made it suck?
Just hanging out finishing up this tea and hen having some leftover Indian food after.
That‚Äôs nice! 
Today I am 100% sober for 1 year solid
Good for you! Also, 100 Demons is that good shit. CTHC forever.
Can't sleep... Got any un-popular opinions? Let's hear em!
It is near impossible to wear airpods and not look like a tool.
Children are ok
Agreed. Plus, they never stay in anyway. 
Pizza ain‚Äôt shit and neither is hotdogs 
Chocolate Ice cream is gross. 
I had diarrhea the first day/night of my honeymoon
Tl;Dr  You had a squirt gun fight with a toilet in Japan
Wow, pretty lucky for an unlucky situation! Congrats on the marriage, btw! 
Thanks so much! We are both late 20s, so it took longer than expected, but she's worth the wait.
What‚Äôs the point of marriage if you can‚Äôt even tell your wife you have diarrhea?
I think my friends have forgotten my birthday :(
I wish everybody would forget my birthday, I hate my birthday! 
Let's switch bodies
Happy birthday pal, I hope that your day will be good and your food be tasty tonight. 
To the one fan I made at my show tonight:
Can i listen to your music?
Sure! I'll message you a streaming link :)
Me too?
I bought my first car !!
Wow nice! I‚Äôll be even more impressed if you aren‚Äôt financing.

Me and my best friend have developed the habit of saying Love you bro at the end of calls
Never stop doing this.
Signed, a bro who never hear his best bro's voice again.
Those of you who put ‚ÄúNo Crazy Bitches‚Äù on your dating profiles: please just quit it. Slight rant.
Why though? It's a good way to weed out assholes 
My pet tortoise is too rambunctious.
Has she ever bitten you? If so how much did it hurt?
I came out and it feels good
Good for YOU!!! 
Today I overheard two women conversing on the subway. At one point, one of them legit turned to her friend (whose name was Becky) and exclaimed Oh my God, Becky! and it literally made my day.
Did anyone around have a nice butt? 
Hell yeah! 
Or so I‚Äôve been told....
OP, do you have a big butt?
Don't lie...
This refers to a song?
My new boss has a first grader that comes to my office after school. Apparently this little guy liked me, and he lets me know about all the gossip about me.
1 st grader are fucking stupid as shit 
Sometimes I eat pizza with a knife and fork
I don't use for and knife, but I have been yelled at (?) for using ranch on my pizza
I am currently up at 2:28 in the morning- let's talk!
Which country are you located?
Le U.S. in New Jersey :D
Dear America, stop putting laugh tracks in your shows.
Oh, finally. I thought I was the only one who found them annoying.
I know right? Big Bang Theory is the worst for them. They practically say them every other line.
Fawlty Towers
Mr Bean
My life
*Hahahahahaa*
*Snort*
As an American, I couldn't agree with you more. It's so incredibly annoying. 
*basic laugh track plays*
thank god now i know it's okay to laugh at that 
Bazinga!
Good comedy shows don't need them. Just look at The Office or Brooklin 99. 
Was just about to say this. Parks and Rec as well.
If I'm not mistaken, they're all produced/written by the same people right?
They're all by Michael Schur (also The Good Place) 
I also believe the ranch is the same.
No, the last season the ranch added laugh tracks.  So annoying. 
Or Malcolm in the middle. 
Does this mean That 70's Show isn't good? *cries*
Ah yes a classic sitcom elitist. Go fuck yourself Mr Spell
How rude Mr. Flex Tape San
Rudeness is a necessary evil young Sir Spell. Only to be used when it's absolutely needed
In all fairness, The IT Crowd also has an annoying laugh track. 
But wasn't it filmed in front of a live audience? I think that's a little different 
Well, so were Friends and TBBT, doesn't stop it feeling out of place. 
It doesn't seem that out of place for Friends. The laugh track has a antiquated 90's feel to it
It seems out of place for a show that is not in the least bit funny. See: Big Bang Theory
Fawlty Towers, Black Books too I think
‚ÄúOk.‚Äù - America 
u/voltex49 hate you for pointing out laugh tracks. Guess were even with my subtitles.
Today is my one year anniversary of no soda!!
Awesome! What differences do you notice?
I‚Äôve lost around 50lbs! Although that‚Äôs a combination of no soda, illness, and working out
Was going to say celebrate it with soda but I guess that's a bad idea right
I thought about it!
‚ù§Ô∏è
I drink a 12-pack of Coke a day. Got any advice for me?
Good job. Been over 3 years for me
Does anyone else have a SO who randomly makes up song lyrics?
Pretty much almost everyone in the world does this. 
I sing to my cats all of the time.  My spouse thinks I'm just a bit odd.
I‚Äôm at work. There‚Äôs no customers. How are you guys spending your Sunday morning?
Just got off work.  Killing time waiting for my car windows  to defrost
I was super drunk last night and texted one of my favorite co-workers i love frog
r/drunktext
Gonna cross post here now, shouldve realized this was a thing. Thank you!! 
What‚Äôs a stereotype that you fit?
Idk I think I fit the stereotype of a normal Swiss person lol
What about the cat eating stereotype?
I‚Äôm Mexican and find mowing my parents lawn therapeutic. 
Jaja, it is pretty relaxing 
You laughed in jaja and not in haha. Confirmed Mexican 
Why would anyone do drugs when they could just mow a lawn?
I fit the British stereotype of being generally avoidant and awkward.
TIL I'm British
Time to pack up and move to where the British folks are at. 
I'm Irish and I love drinking...
Teacher ... I ask a lot of question and give a lot of information. ‚ÄúDid you know ...?‚Äù üë©üèª‚Äçüè´üòÇ
I‚Äôm vegan and annoying (lol only sort of kidding)
I'm white and can't stand a jalapeno. 
But do you like mayo? 
Thankfully, no.
Middle-aged white guy really into World War 2 stuff.
Oh yeah I heard about that... Which country won? 
I'm Canadian and I love poutine and maple syrup
... not together... 
Together is the truly supreme poutine
Poutine is Quebecois.
It's become a national dish but yes, the French Canadians did invent it.
Well, international, since Quebec is a distinct nation.
Middle aged woman. Love cardigans, cats, books, plants. Garden has special rose varieties.
I'm a Jew and have a really big nose.
Also I'm russian and drink way too much.
Do you live in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast?
&gt;Bagelman
Yup, found the Jew. Fellow big-nosed Semite checking in.
Hey me too, is there some sort of club we can form?
Count me in also
Me three!
Hey I'm not Jewish but I love bagels!
*Quickly feels nose*
Kosher vodka?
I'm Dutch. Don't own a car, only a bike. 
But do you bike while smoking a joint on your way to pick some tulips?
I live in Utah and just learned that I‚Äôm Dutch ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You should buy a bike soon
I'm a latvian and my main food is potatoes. I eat them almost every day.
British. I drink like 2-4 mugs of tea a day.
Teeth thing doesn't apply to me though, luckily.
Unfortunately I am that white dude that puts holes in drywall. Im working on it.
imagine the word: Gamer
yeah that
I, too, hate women and minorities 
Truly an epic gamer moment
Praise Geraldo
Rise up
How many waifu dakis do you own?
Less than you'd think, but more than you'd hope.
GAMERS RISE UP
Italian American here. Yes I'm short, fat, and loud 
I'm gay and I am sooo flamboyant...
I am a scrawny white guy and I love mayonnaise and sandwiches drowning in mayo.
I hate mayo so that‚Äôs my worst nightmare sandwich lmao. 
I'm British and like talking about the weather. 
I'm Dutch, and I looooove cheese!
I drive a subaru and I vape. 
i‚Äôm a blonde white girl and i like victoria‚Äôs secret and iced coffee :(
Im from the pacific northwest so I listen to a lot of metal and grunge, and I love rain.
Agalloch?
I'm an American in my 20s and I have depression 
I‚Äôm asian and I love white guys.
What do you all like to do on your saturdays?
I hate Saturday's I just feel lonely 
I agree
Eat pizza, I'm not even joking I eat pizza for dinner every Saturday
Homemade, store bought, or delivered?
Mostly store bought but sometimes I make them
Have you tried a mix of both? Buy a cheese pie and add toppings yourself 
I just confirmed that my roommate has been faking a relationship with a fake girlfriend. A girl that doesn‚Äôt even exist.
Honestly tho, if he ain‚Äôt hurting nobody, then let him do him. Whatever makes him happy. 
Harley
Does Harley like puppuccinos? He deserves some for all he‚Äôs been through 
He always gets a biscuit and tonight he got two because he‚Äôs been working so hard! 
Ask if you can take a pic for the subreddit!!!
God I love dogs lol
My girlfriend broke up with me and i need to talk about anything other than that to distract me until i fall asleep.
What're your favourite movies of all time? 
The 22.02.2022 won't just be a Tuesday. It will be my 22nd birthday!

Yay! So happy for you!!!
Don't forget to embarrass your significant other with a little bit of cake on their face.
She‚Äôs gonna blow your brother in 4 years
Ive just woken out of an 11 month coma.
Apex Legends is the new Fortnite.
Fortnite is still a thing? I played a little bit during the christmas event.
Yep. There‚Äôs been a whole new Christmas event too, while you were in a coma.
Stardew Valley multiplayer is a thing now.  It's pretty fun!
I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you; but all your favourite memes are dead. 
There‚Äôs no more porn on tumblr. 
this is the most damning news someone can wake up to. why u gotta do him like that
never was a tumblr fan to begin with
That‚Äôs the best response. It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into porn‚Äú, it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into Tumblr. ‚Äú  :p
Why were you in a coma exactly?
Maybe I‚Äôll get downvoted for this, but... I don‚Äôt believe you without some sort of proof 
Check out the new csgo ui! 
Xbox still didn't release any good games.
We‚Äôre genetically engineering babies now.
Science!
You‚Äôve woken up in the future!
Happy sixteenth! How's the quest for driving going? ;)
Pretty bad. I'm fucking nineteen already and still can't drive without a permit.
r/nobodyasked
The world is WAY more pc now
We haven't solved climate change yet
You should try posting this on r/IAmA if you didnt do it yet.
I wish you a wonderful new life 
I will do that!
Very nice! See you in the front page :P
(Again, best wishes from pasta country) 
Post history checks out
go on r/AMA, and post this, much better there.
Did anyone see your first moments out of your coma?
YOU MISSED INFINITY WAR!!!! 
Why did you post here after your AMA request was deleted for lack of proof? 
It wasnt deleted, I deleted it myself, &amp; It was posted here first.
Why did you delete it? 
Didnt think people would want to see it if I couldnt prove it.
A picture of an egg broke the record for most liked picture on Instagram.
we live in a society.
So lucky you didn't have to wait all this time for the final season of game of thrones!
Welcome to the future, everything is chrome.
Great? cant wait to see what the mars rover is up to!
Can you sub to pewdiepie? 
I used to judge people for their ‚Äúweird‚Äù orders at Starbucks. Decaf, soy milk, no foam, extra sirup... ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you drink a normal coffee like everyone else you freak‚Äù. But today it changed.
This is called growth.
And aging...
Some people age and don't grow much at all.
Some people grow too much and stop aging.
Morbid obesity?
elephantiasis
RIP Andre the Giant
touch√©
I never understood why anyone cares what other people enjoy. 
A lot of people are enraged by anything different from themselves.
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd think that way
That's NOT funny!
Oh fuck, my bad
Don't apologize, I don't need your pity.
üéµIn-se-cu-rity üé∂ 
A lot of people also have diabetes and need sugar free drinks. 
My question is why even get a latte if it has no caffeine?
Why don‚Äôt you just order an americano or a regular coffee no cream?
People enjoy coffee without the caffeine?
There are tons of caring Americans.
I love this post, my guy. 
I‚Äôm not your guy, pal.
I‚Äôm not your pal, dude. 
Out of curiosity, what state did you first move to?
I‚Äôm having a great morning, how‚Äôs yours?

Mine cries at parades and when she thinks of cake.
How does she feel about the fact that swans can be gay?
That's been 3 years? Wtf

I like yellow. What‚Äôs your favorite color? 
Green!
Turtles!
Are you sure you're a human being? 
Please mark all the pictures with Lampposts in them.
Hello fellow EarthLing..my favourite color is grey,what's yours?
Well human it's pastel pink or any pastel color really 
I really like pink, black and purple. How about you? 
Blue with a slight green tint. I just bought a shit ton of blue-ish fountain pen ink.
Damn I only have one pen that's pastel pink but it looks like a really shitty pastel pink. 
That's a damn shame, really. I can imagine that on some cream-colored paper. Mmmm.
Yes exactly! I bought paper just for it and well would you look at that it looks like crap!
My favorite color is specifically royal purple cus its just so....*regal*
My oh my your highness I am but a mere peasant *bows*

Best of luck to you!!
I‚Äôm drunk and I want to know what‚Äôs going on in your days lives
Terrible what? 
Well, I'm staying home today since I couldn't sleep last night.
A night at home just can be very relaxing. How come you couldn‚Äôt sleep though? 
Thinking...
I could kill myself and no one would care. Would be like I've never existed.
Well.. someone's gotta clean it up.
Is this a joke?
No joke.  Someone's day would be totally fucked.  I hope that makes you feel a little better.
Well realistically no actually. There are people who have jobs to handle such things.
Waiting on pizza delivery.
Aye lit. What kinda pizza? Please tell me it has pineapples 
It does indeed have pineapple on it. Nomnomnom.
Yesss 
Good morning! My day is going to be good. Might head to the aquarium. 
Heyyyy!! Takes lots of pictures :) 
Does anyone else wish they had someone in their life that would just tell them, Everything's going to be OK or I've got you?
It's gonna be ok. I believe in you.
yeeeees i feel this all the time 
I love you. We'll get through this.
Yep. But i dont. Cause i am the who does that but no one ever does that for me
I spent 3 years in prison. Dropped out of college when I was 20.
Congrats man. 
Just wanted to say I love your positive attitude! 
I‚Äôd like to study Nutrition
It feels good to brag a little dont you think ?
I'm just proud of myself I guess! Though school is a lot of work, I spend all my time studying.
Yes, me too dude

Congratulations. I shall pray for your further recovery and success. Godspeed on your journey.

I‚Äôm learning to ride a motorcycle this spring! April can‚Äôt come fast enough!
May 7! Turning 39!
April 15th!

(Are we happy for that though?)
I upvote comments that are cordial well-formed arguments even if I disagree with the POV of the comments.
I thought I was being too soft! But I do this all the time.
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one! Otherwise threads become echo chambers.
I get downvoted everywhere since I feel like commenting when I disagree.. my karma is leaking
Yeah, no one believes that.
Do you ever spend your whole day lounging in bed?
Yes. Today being one of them.
What do you like to listen to?
I personally enjoy dubstep alot, one of my favourite song being Pyromaniac - Sound Stabs
I broke down and spent all day cleaning my apartment - and I learned how important cleaning is to mental health in the process.
Good going, OP. Jordan did have a point.
it‚Äôs my cake day so i wanted to post
Cake, ice cream and mojito, not necessarily in that order
Still not sure what cake day is, but happy birthday? This too shall pass. 
My cat heightens my mood everyday, I couldn‚Äôt be without my boy.
Boys should be cared for too
I think men should be treated very lovingly and affectionately and spoiled too.
Recently lost 30 pounds and was told that I was hot
Take it as a compliment and enjoy it.
Haha I lost 60 pounds and all I found out was I wasn't ugly because I was fat. I was just ugly.
Not trying to diminish your accomplishment but it is possible he was embellishing to get laid.
How'd you do it?
What lose weight? Or get laid? 
Found a redditor at the movie theater today.
Yikes
Reward that man one yike point
Is that a currency
But is the movie good?
I can see through the lies of the Jedi, and the CGI
Sounds like a path to the dark side, to me.
Me:  How the hell did OP know he was a Redditor....
Also me:  Oh, yeah for sure. 
Did he have his fedora in his hands or on his head?
Apparently I'm so awful I have a cult sermon about me
Imagine what it‚Äôs like to be that stupid lol. How frustrating life must be. 
but, if all you gotta do is pray the trouble away...
Let me guess they're JWs?
Sounds like it.
Reverse AMA!
go ahead! I'm an open book!
What is the name of your book so far? 
I‚Äôm an open book. Ask me anything 
If it's not too late let's go!
It isn't! How would you describe the typical fan you know of your favorite teams?
ask me :)
I'm here. 
boop
I just love how we consider the mars rover to be almost like a family pet.
He was a good boy.
The best boy
I love how we don't realize the family pet is the size of a minivan
Humans will pack bond with anything
That's why Earth is the capitol of the United Federation of Planets.
True, I pack bonded with your mom last night
I love you all.
I needed this. Thanks, OP. Love you too.
Accidentally trolled a woman while I was getting flowers today
Okay. This story made me laugh. Thank you. 
I'm starting laughing about it. It was spur of the moment and I'm glad I seized it.
LOL got a laugh from me!
You'd be surprised how many times I've heard this for real as a florist... 
How sweet of you to get your wife‚Äôs friend flowers too!
Well she is my second wife and all :)
.. Username checks out?
We hold these truths to be self evident
Do women actually like flowers anymore? Or do they think it's trite, like holding doors?
I'm married to a walking success story
Now to make sure to save $ and be frugal!!!for rainy days 
Yessss!! I wanna see 7 figures in that savings account lol
That's cool, gives me (a computer nerd who gets bad grades) some hope
Is your husband single?
Oh man you owe him a 3 some lol
looooool omg
he probably thinks so too
Can I be your baby sister? üòÇ
Don‚Äôt get your hope up to high. He‚Äôs probably about to divorce you and marry a supermodel. 
I bet he thinks he earned it all lol
If you have 0 spending money don't have a kid lmao
65,000 a year is broke? 
Yikes. I guess I‚Äôm worse off than I thought. 
+1
im here earning 18k pa :(
It's just a day. There's nothing special about it.
As long as the liqour store nearby has the same deals as last year, im fine with today.
You think I have friends???
Hi. I'll be your friend
Who wants to play a guessing game?
let's give a try, why not
Who's the punisher? Frank or Jimmy?
Hey can I still play?
Yes!! Would you like to think of a thing or guess? 
Guess 
Okay I'm thinking of a thing. Go ahead and ask anything. 
Ok is it a person
Neither 
Ok can it be found in a persons house?
Can you pick it up in one hand 
Yeah

Is it for cooking 
Here let's just start again here:) 
Is it an animal? 
Ok no it is not a animal
Hm is it man made? 
Is it edible? 
Is it bigger than a fridge?
Hey! You still here to play?
Sure am! Would you like to guess or think of a thing. 
I'd like to guess if that's alright!
Okie doke! I'm thinkin of a thing:) 
Alright, is it a food?
Yes :)

With all the ‚Äúfuck men‚Äù announcements, I‚Äôm a big fan of this post. You made my day op
100% we need to normalise complimenting boys like we do with girls 
I‚Äôm a month away from 20 years old and haven‚Äôt had a single relationship yet, I needed that.
That's really normal for Gen Z, FYI, if that helps to know.
That last paragraph makes me think die Antwoord wrote this üòÇ

Hey dude fuck off

Men are shit
Some are, but some girls are too.

Weirdest coincidence I've ever experienced.
So, When are you going to say just the Hello ?
I did right after I dropped him off at school.
I just walked into Home Depot after work, and one of the employees asked me if I was doctor (because I was wearing scrubs) when I replied ‚ÄúYes‚Äù he said ‚ÄúHell yea! Keep up the good job saving lives man!‚Äù And that completely made my day.
What kinda doctor are you?
Neurosurgeon. 
Neurosurgeon with a sense of humor, Ron Burgundy is your profile pic.
I‚Äôm an OR nurse, and neuro is one of my favorite services to work!
You have good energy. I approve. 
I think you should do an AMA.... we clearly have lots to ask :)
Trying to finish up work early so I can day drink and play videogames
I had a 3 hour panic attack last night :( thanks ptsd

Have you checked out Apex Legends? 
Anyone else always look forward to weekends, but when they arrive, you find yourself sitting home doing nothing and wasting them?
Friggin winter, man. 
This! Weekends in winter are for watching movies and not trying to do too much work, IMO. 
Winter + regular depression = super depression  
Super depression + chocolate = super depression, but with chocolate. 
Currently doing this rn! :)
Yup, procrastinating on Reddit is what I do best 
It's what everyone on hear does ;)

Pulled chicken and quinoa.
I no longer use social media and feel less depressed, anxious and worried.
Is Reddit not social media?
I had no idea what to make my username. I tried to put whyme, but pressed D by mistake. 
Cassy and Cat were my nicknames in high school.
I just used my name. 
My daughter just asked if I was alive in 1989.
I can‚Äôt wait for 1989 to be the new 1889
For me it's the 1996 to be like 1896
I want 2002 to be like 1002.
DEUS VULT.
Hell of a username, my dude
I can wait...because by then I‚Äôll be old and my bones will hurt.
Can you imagine what the world will be like in 2089?
Insightful

Trust me, it doesn't get better! 
Opiates? More like NOPEiates amirite?

Embrace the pain. Master it, make it serve you.
Great job man! I hope the tooth doesn't hurt you too much
I got offered a job a while ago, but they told me wearing lipstick was a requirement.

Do adults actually care what a senior is gonna do after high school, or do they just ask because that‚Äôs what you ask a senior?
Uh, they care!! Obviously! Isnt it only your family asking you??
Nope. 9/10 times when it comes up that I‚Äôm a senior they ask the question no matter who it is
And how often does that come up??
About every time I meet someone new or see someone for the first time in a while
Thats way more often than should be 
I'm approximately 39 chicken nuggets tall.
How many if you went by thickness of the Nuggets?
About 193 chicken nuggets if you round up.
r/TheyDidTheMaths
I'm about 36.5 nuggets. You're a tall dude.
I owe my height to chicken nuggets.
Im only 33 chicken nuggets tall. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
r/theydidthemonstermath
I'm only 34.5 :(
I'm slightly over 33.
I'm 32 nuggets, fight me :(
I'm only 5 Subways tall.
Not only is it your cake day but regardless of you're height you're priceless!
And 30 nuggets, which is still easy math. 
For me, there is no such thing as easy math.
My brain is too tired to do math
Don't worry I texted my friend before I posted it so they could verify I did the math correctly.
Is your friend a mathmagician?
I came here thinking the was a picture of 39 nuggets stacked next to you
Jesus are you 12 
I‚Äôm 34.5 chicken nuggets tall. 
If I'm 5'4, how many nuggets tall am I? I'm too bad at math for this rn
This is super convenient considering I also am 6‚Äô4‚Äù tall!
As a math teacher, I kind of want to make my kids find their height in chicken nuggets now...
Well fully grown male here and I'm only just over 33 why are you all so tall
Let's play a game of truth or dare!
Truth, please.
What is the first thing you see that is not your phone screen
A plastic container of Tomtastic premium cherry tomatoes on the kitchen counter.
Hell, I'll take a dare
I dare you to do 50 squats in a row. No stopping.
Why did I say dare. Well I'm off to do 50 squats.
Make me an mspaint (or equivalent) meme. 
What's the pettiest thing that makes you mad
What immoral thing would you jump to do given the opportunity/power to? 
What's your biggest pet peeve 
I'm curious to see what dares pop up ?  
So dare

So i cried reading this, this is amazing. You are amazing.
No, you're amazing!  Chin up!
Bro. This shit brought a tear to my eye. I wish someone would notice my pain and do this.
Virtual hug in the meantime? *HUUUUG*
Man that pizza must've had loads of onions cause my eyes be crying like crazy
Perhaps his boyfriend simply turned into the moon.
Still rough though, buddy.
I never knew sokka was gay

Good enough for me
My dad gave me the nicest compliment I've ever received.
He sounds like a really wonderful guy. I‚Äôm glad you have him as your dad.
I'm really grateful to have him around :) I owe everything that I have to him.
Does it matter? Jeez..
Yes, it does.
Because it allows me to better understand the context of this conversation.
What context is there? Their dad paid them a compliment. It‚Äôs pretty straightforward.
Is it father-son bonding or father-daughter bonding, though?
What difference does it make?? I really don't understand what the point is lmao.
Completely agreed.
Imagine receiving compliments from your dad :')
Take care of your of him, OP.
My dad's a prick
I'm sorry
It's not your fault
Maybe it is
I also have a dad

I couldn‚Äôt tell ya. I guess they just post at the right time, and in the right places.
I no huh???
The perk of being an adult is doing your own grocery shopping. Today I bought a green tea-scented dishwashing liquid and I am very happy.
The downside of being an adult and doing your own grocery shopping is paying for it .__.
Enjoy the little things. 
It brings you joy so it's important. Joy makes a good life.
Is this undercover marketing for Joy brand dishwashing liquid
It's not a thing in Germany.
Wait until you find out that you can have chocolate cake for breakfast...

I upvoted a YouTube video from 9.9K to 10K. It was probably the greatest moment of my life
My autistic son was abused by a teacher‚Äôs aide
We really need to stop using abused as an umbrella term
How was this not abuse?
Wait why did the first lawyer yell at your son? I‚Äôm confused
I would punch my way through that aid's skull.
She's lucky you're the father...
r/Iamverybadass
Sounds like your son doesn't belong in public education to me.
Was this in the news? I think I remember hearing about it.

That my eyes tear up randomly.
I don't know why.
Why is everyone on reddit so rude?
you should definitely see what goes on twitter if you think reddit is rude
Because reddit is full of kids
Honest question, how old are you?
30
Welcome to Reddit
Anonymity gives people courage.
Being on reddit, you are automatically somehow better than everyone else.
Go fuck yourself.
I rather be rude on reddit than real life ..
Rude = Upvotes
Anybody feel like they're just floating through life right now?

Wanna talk about it?

Hey! How‚Äôs it going?
Good! How are you?
Doing pretty well! What‚Äôs your favorite tv show?
I don't really watch a lot of tv, so it's hard to answer.
What do you like to do in your spare time in that case?
I spend a lot of my time listening to music and checking sports stuff.

Not too much, just watching some Netflix, hbu?

Today two little girls sweetly played with my son at the splash park. He has autism, he‚Äôs nonverbal and makes ‚Äúodd‚Äù sounds and motions. Most kids walk away and ignore him as soon as they don‚Äôt get a standard interaction. They asked questions and continued to interact! Made my whole week!
This made me SO happy to read!
I‚Äôm so glad!!
It‚Äôs these kind of stories that really put a smile on my face
Wholesome, cute and pure
Same!! üòç
I'm not crying....you're crying. :)
You have to consider that the majority of the time, his kid gets ostracized
Autism dad here. It's always nice to see kids who just see our kids as just fellow kids.
Police showed up to my house because of ‚Äúdomestic violence‚Äù.
That's some good revenge. Always go after the food!
I'd give them some chili, the special kind though
How special? I want to know how far you'll go. :p
Ever hear of scott tenorman?
I need a good Chili recipe.  Wanna share? :)
I can‚Äôt sorry.  All I can say is Cincinnati chili with an Asian touch.
Flagstaff police fucking suck. All the ones I‚Äôve met have been assholes
My wife and I are expecting our first son at any moment

Thoughts on their Live Aid Performance?
Bohemian Rapsody is the best song ever made.
Queen is trash
I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl, and I adore Queen!
I hate how technology has turned people into jerks.
You actually get matches on dating apps???
Maybe once every 3-4 months. Half of them unmatched right away
But half didn't...
If half didn‚Äôt what? Then I‚Äôd have twice as many people that ignore me?
Have you ever been considered a regular somewhere?
Define ‚Äúregular.‚Äù Do you mean I go there every day or what?
I‚Äôm a bit sad and lonely right now, so tell me a random fact to distract me!
Watch how toddlers move for a natural example of proper deadlift and squat form.

You know what I think is fucked up?
Is this show/beauty peagent only in the US? I don't think I 've seen anything similar in Europe?
The rest of the world already knows this is fucked up. Only in America.
The important thing is, you didn't miss an opportunity to shit on America.
You're so brave!
I don't really know how to respond to this.

I just started eating fruit.
If you're a fan of water based fruits I'd recommend freezing them about halfway for new flavors
Like a strawberry or something?
I think so, watermelon is my favorite example however
I will try that. Have you seen people cook watermelon 'steaks'?
I just looked it up, that's definitely a no lol
Are you Charlie Kelly?
Is it watermelon season yet? I can't wait to buy and eat it whole.
Even if it is they definitely don't grow it where I am.
Is anyone always so tired after work that the only thing they can do is just kind of lay there and try to prepare to do it again tomorrow?

Yo I hate this damn story.
Your boss is a gigantic gaylord
Today I voluntarily woke up at 5:30 am for the first time, and I feel happier than I‚Äôve felt in weeks

Your upvote said User used upvotes, its super effective!
Yer an upvoter, Harry! :)
BECAUSE I'M BATMAN!
10/10 would upvote again.

Can you tell me what my upvote says?
Up, up, up...it's outta here!

i wish it worked on mobile. i‚Äôm away from my computer
Your upvote says: I'm a princess!

I introduced an older relative to Reddit and I think they got lost in it somewhere because they no longer send me ten texts/im a day
I am 63. I introduced my 31 year old daughter to Reddit. Yes, we are here.
I'm 60 lol...we are hiding in plain sight
Sadly, few seem to notice us, or care.
I just don't mention it much. No more than the 13 year olds do lol
Maybe we should?
With all the Boomer hate out there? lol
We are still ordinary people. Right?
I'm 65. Nice to see some fellow sexagenarians.

Just had a baby. Turns out Newborns are forkin expensive.
Oh believe me it gets way worse üòÇüòÇ
I'm sorry, but you only realized having a kid would be pricy once it was already out?
Just quit my job
13hrs isn't that unreasonable.
It is. It may be more common than people realize but it‚Äôs still unreasonable
Just made lasagna for two but ended up eating it all myself.
Lasagna too good to be shared.
Anyone else just hate how drinking alcohol is a norm?
Not me I love alcohol. It‚Äôs just awesome.
Experts say that if alcohol was a new drug it would 100% be illegal
Me, probably because I'm Muslim and biased lol.
No. It's fun. Loosen up a little mate.

Can someone translate Celsius into Fahrenheit for my dumb, American ass?
19c is 66f.
66 is perfect weather... what are you whining about?
My guy that‚Äôs just below room temperature.
Room temp here is 90 F (30 C) lol
Hmm. Can you convert the Celsius to inches for me?
1C is half a burger per football field
How about cubic feet of rainfall?
1 of that is half a freedom eagle times yeehaw
Interesting.. Atleast now I can measure the circumference of a horse in gallons

Good to go.

Where have you been my entire life.
Haha over in Australia
Ahh that explains it you have an anti American defense mechanism.... giant ass spiders

Why this person didn't marry you on the spot is beyond me. 
Some people have no taste.

If you punch yourself and it hurts are you strong or weak?
Hello! My name is Carol and my granddaughter told me that I could have a chat with new people on the internet in this website. I find facebook boring. How are you doing today?
have you looked into r/knitting r/cooking r/recipes r/gardening
Hi Carol!!!
Can we blow this up! (Make it seen by thousands)
It's fake, it shouldn't be seen by anyone
This is so obviously fake. Reddit is so stupid
Yup. Look at everyone lapping it up. Lmao.
This smells of bullshit.
Carol, you are thrice my age, and I am very attracted to you.
So fake dude lmfao
This restored my faith in humanity
This aged poorly
This kid just karma farmed the shit out of you
I read edit 4 and shit my pants, I got got!
Audible laughter upon reading that 4th edit. Holy shit.

Why was this deleted?
I was having really bad day but then I got rid of a blackhead that had been bothering me for over a year

Why I think Reddit is the best social media platform
*All of this changed when the fire nation attacked*
And there are subreddits for literally everything. And I do mean everything lol. But welcome!
I know right? Some subreddits are so odd that they make me question my life lol
Me too. I have come across some really weird subreddits lol. Take a look at r/forbiddensnacks.
Bold of you to call Reddit a social media platform
What should I change my first name to?
Enrico
Nice name, but It‚Äôs awfully exotic for a basic white boy like me
What about James? I know it's just 1 syllable but it might fit neatly.
Wilson or Calvin?
How about Christopher or Victor?
What's your middle name?
Comment a song and I‚Äôll rate it out of 10
Make You Mine- PUBLIC
Self Care-Mac Miller
What‚Äôs everyone doing right in this moment ?

Story of my life lol Fav youtubers?
Waiting for my mom to call and tell me if she‚Äôs okay or not.
Just over 2 years ago I was T-boned in an intersection by a Learner that wasn't paying attention to traffic. Today was the first day I woke up WITHOUT pain!
Try Keaton
I've never heard of it, I'll have to look into it. Thank you!
Oh shit I am a learner, Ill have to triple check traffic now.
Did you sue?
I got a really nice payout from insurance, I didn't see a need to go further with it :)
I dont remember that last time I thought about killing myself.
Can't relate. Last time was today for me.
Working hour 6 of a 12 hour shift, looking for some people to chat with to pass time!

Hello Reddit! We need positive help at r/SuicideWatch
r/suicidewatch

No you're the hero!
No, no. You are THE hero
I don‚Äôt have anyone to tell the happy news to, but I came out to my sister and she took it really well.
I‚Äôm super proud of you :)
Are you planning on coming out to your parents?
Not for the foreseeable future. They‚Äôre the disowning type, even though I love them very much.
I‚Äôm sorry about that man
From one Jew to another, welcome friend ü§òü§ò
What‚Äôs xtain mean?
Christian.
May god forgive you of your sins.
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a sin to be judgemental
My boyfriend is learning how to ride a bike
Helmets. Everyone. Helmets. Please. Former EMT here. That is all.
Yes, definitely. Thank you

Thanks! Do you still ride?
I think I need to do the same. Never ended up learning as a kid. :(
What do people do on summer break?
Nows a better time then ever to build up good habits of going to the gym if you aren‚Äôt already
Gyms are expensive!!
Assuming you‚Äôre in the US plenty of gyms have memberships for as little as 10/month
Honestly, I just wish it was socially acceptable to wear a cape/cloak all the time.
Somewhere a genie heard you and now you're the protag of another isekai
Synchronize with people all around the world to start a cape/cloak wearing trend.
Honestly, I'm down.
I‚Äôm down. Where do we start?
Me too keep me in the info
Start a sub
I wanted a cloak for a long time! Ankle length, hooded, and in pine green.
Edna would not approve
i showered for the first time in four days!
Fuck buddy i go 4 days easy without showering sometimes when im bogged with work
im super picky about my greasy hair. thats my main thing about not showering.
Dry shampoo.  It's a game changer.

Try no poo
I tend to not use poo in my hair. Leaves a awful smell
I cleaned my main closet today, might seem little, but it's something that I'm proud of
Anyone up to talk?
It is so hot
Im down.
What happened?
How do you guys take your coffee? Searching for just the right style

This is sad because my uncle had a heart attack and died.  He was only 55.
Anyone else just want a hug right now?
I could really use a hug. I have a bunch of shit going on right now &amp; it all just sucks.
Ugh, me too...
Feel free to tell me about it.
I feel miserable and lonely every day
You should try making a friend. But here‚Äôs a virtual hug until you find one.
Thats not an option sadly
Why‚Äôs that.
I wish I could hug all of you
I give you a virtual hug

Yeah. Big hug, please. Didn‚Äôt get the job... üòü
I want a hug, a big one im just feeling down.

It's not much but congratulations on your graduation though
Thank you. Are you feeling better since you posted this?

Could be worse. You could be lawful good.
Who would be ashamed to ve lawful good, objectively the best alignment.
Not necessarily
The *most boring alignment, FTFY üòÅ
The owner thinks you think the owner is beautiful!
I am fine with this being an outcome of the interaction as well.

Congrats! Hope you have a Nice wedding and future together!
Hey, congratulations!!!
I‚Äôve stopped using Facebook and Instagram, leaving reddit as my sole social media outlet. Who else has done this and how has it changed you?
I only use Facebook to make an account somewere
A lady called me a perv
That's so stupid. Maybe she thought that you were trying to look good to hit on her?
She was crazy. End of story
Hello, police?  A man walked past my front porch, whistling a dirty song.
Ugly or Fat?
I'm sorry?
Was she fat or ugly?
She didn't seem so, I wasn't really paying attention to that, why?
Just a question, well, you haven't quite answered it.
All this talk of hat removal is getting me all hot n' ready
Calm down, little Caesar.
Maybe she thought you tipped your hat at her to get ready to compliment m'lady.
Do guys still tip hats to girls like that.
Only the nicest of gentlemen obviously.
I joined this subreddit just to post this
That's really cool!
Do you know where in Germany she comes from?
Nuremburg...born and raised
Ah... I lived there for some time. Has she ever been back after the war?
Amazing, tell her birthday wishes from Finland! We'd call her an iron grandma.
I call my grandparents Oma and Opa too!!
I'm 14. This is why I avoid vaping like the plague.
Im14andIdontvape
Good for you! Don‚Äôt let up!
##bruh do you have a boof I can hit??
Why would somebody be hitting something up another dudes ass?
That‚Äôs not normal?
So, what your saying Juul stock is a buy?
r/wallstreetbets
I just got a dog last night!!!
DOG TAX PLEASE.
What's a dog tax lol
A picture of the doggy :D
I don't know how to post pics properly here D:
Sweet! First pet?
Actually no! We had a dog for one night but we had to let it go since I was allergic to it
Oh dang. No issues with this one I hope?
Can I be your friend too?
Why not??? You my friend now ;D
My grandma has had dental problems for years but now got her teeth done so she's sending pics around to everyone

Today on the bus there was a transgender woman and a lady literally moved seats to not have to sit next to her. So I moved seats to sit next to her. She realized that woman moved seats to avoid her and I could tell she was hurt.
As a trans woman myself, thank you dear stranger for this kind jest of humanity ‚ù§Ô∏è
trans woman 
a man*
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
&gt; opinion is wrong
It's a meme lol, trans women are women
I have an incredibly female username, and yet on reddit, I'm still assumed male
Honestly, I imagine everyone as me until proven otherwise. I read replies in my voice.
Can you suggest me good music?
Give Arcade Fire a listen
First time hearing about them. I'll give then a try
specifically the suburbs
I just listened to
Loved it! 
oh thats great, they have a song featuring bowie too if you‚Äôre into him, ( who isn‚Äôt of course )
I love Bowie!! Which song would that be?
Its called ‚Äúreflektor‚Äù. There are also numerous videos on yt of them performing songs with him
Blood like lemonade by Morcheeba
Kill of the night by Gin Wigmore
I shall give them a try
Looking to have a friendly discussion
Hi, how was your day?
My day was great, how about you?
A bit sad
What kinda tv shows are you a fan of?
Praising Keanu makes him visually uncomfortable. We as fans need to dial it back a bit.
You know he's an actor, right?
He is?
He looks like i feel when people sing 'happy birthday' to me.
This right here. That‚Äôs the exact look!
You‚Äôre breathtaking
No YOU‚ÄôRE breathtaking
YOU‚ÄôRE ALL BREATHTAKING
I CAN'T BREATHE WITH ALL OF YOU HERE
 Just get a plant or something
Plant a few trees maybe
Or we could just dial back celebrity worship in general.
Exactly. Praise /u/staticsnake !
/u/staticsnake is breathtaking
Let's make r/staticsnake to praise them
Can I be a mod?
Or dial back cult of personality in general.
do you really think this post will affect the world even 0.00000001%?
Just found out my grandfather has had reddit longer than me and has more karma as well!
Your grandpa is cooler than you. Heck, he's probably cooler than most of us
Cooler than me
50 times cooler than you to be more exact.
Gramps, killed some Nazis in WW2 AND kills it at Reddit better than you.
Big oof. F in chat.
this is really great...thank you. :)
Thank you for being alive! &lt;3
NO U DONT
Oh, but I do üòè
But what if im a serial killer?
I thought I'd be a lot more angry if I ever found out who stole items from the inside of my vehicles.
Lighting a cigarette whilst sleep walking is super sketchy
Yeah for sure. Dozing off while smoking isn't a great idea.
I hope there‚Äôs a sufficient amount of space between your house and your neighbors...
Missed my train, now have to wait an hour and 40 minutes for the next one. How's your day going?
Why not take an Uber ride home? Waiting 40 mins for a train seems like a total waste of time.
Its over an hourish of driving to get home
I was given my first Father's Day gift yesterday.
who's cutting onions round here.........?
I‚ÄôM NOT CRYING, YOU ARE
Aw geez, my heart. Here's to you Dad!
Thank you so much. I might start crying all over again.
Don‚Äôt worry OP, we are all crying with you
Shoutout to the following thankless careers
And thank YOU for leaving cops off the list
Does anyone ever want to just... Run away and start over?
I'm doing this! I run away tomorrow!
What are some ‚ÄúDad‚Äù things your dad does?
Disappear
My dad: tries to do all the housework
Leaves and doesn't come back
Medieval weapons and cool shirts
Children
Making someone laugh is the best feeling ever
I'd like to see a montage of these moments in my life.
Mine would be very long
I‚Äôm getting married in three hours.
Congratulations
Sooooo How was it???
OMGGG I LOVE LOVE
How planning to kill myself March 2020 actually probably saved my life. [30F]
What do you do for a living
I design apps
That‚Äôs cool
I [19M] got my first kiss last night
So did you get here number?
Absolutely got her number lol
Congrats buddy! Ahhh to be 19 again haha. Good for you. Hopefully it turns to more?
Congratulations! Howd you two meet?
Is anyone else extremely triggered seeing someone type 'lose' as 'loose'?
Triggers me too. Two seperate words.
separate -- sorry, had to do it üòÇ
Yes, drives me bonkers. I've also recently seen, 'Sorry for your lost. Argh!
Yyyyyeeep.
Breath and breathe makes me livid as well
Wait, people spell breathe as breath?! 
or do people spell breath as breathe
Both.  It's infuriating.  Takes my breathe away
YES! I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TYPE LOOSE! IT'S LOSE! YOU'RE NOT TIGHTENING ANYTHING UP
yes and stuff like 'boi' and 'smol'. drives me nuts
yeah at this point i just don‚Äôt care anymore
Let's talk! Tell me something interesting about you
I've put out a list of my favorite songs each year for the past 20 years
friday friyayy! 5 q's to send you away to the weekend!
1. Pride
2. Work
3. ScarJo
4. If you can't, you should probably run.
5. Yes.
pride..?
So, busy day? (;
some might say..
That's too bad. But I wasn't about to leave without an LG reply!
ayeee
(: That kinda made my day.
hehe welllll talking about making your day..
welllllllllll i mean.. let's just say we can leave that for a more private conversation..
I figured out why everyone is anonymous on reddit. It's so you can be honest to yourself.
Plus it makes it way easier to call someone a fucker!
Or support someone who is being blasted by an entire sub.
Either way, NO FEAR!
Yeah!
Also, you're a fucker, ha!
Got em.
U should post this on r/TheoryofReddit. It‚Äôs a realistic interpretation
I can‚Äôt because too many people who I know irl know my reddit handle üî´
WiFi network name: Which one of these options should I rename my WiFi?
Oh my god
Bill wi the science fi

Im about to get my masters degree!!
Knock ‚Äòem dead, kid! ü§òüèº
Congratulations!! Best of luck, you've got this!!
A message to anyone visiting the USA
If you‚Äôre black that‚Äôs a double threat
The same in Canada too. But that's probably because we're very close to the US culturally
Not anywhere near as bad. In Canada you don't really assume that everyone is armed
I unsubscribed from trashy and other subs that insult people
\&gt;:( *YOU'RE TRASHY*
jk ily :)
Lol. ** *NO YOU'RE TRASHY! * **
oof :( how did you know?
Takes one to know one! /s
Can you name some of them?
Life is better without Facebook and Instagram
I mean, your obviously still on reddit...
And now you're on Reddit. Whats the point
But you‚Äôre still on Reddit....
Black Mirror Season 3 Episode 6 Nosedive fits in perfectly with this
I just got my bachelor's degree as graphic designer
Hey good for you! I'm currently working towards getting my bachelors in graphics design too!
Congratulations! The feeling after finishing a degree is quite amazing.
It is! Thank you so much! And happy cake day :)
Welcome! And Thank you :)

Happy Birthday, buddy! üíê
What is something you are looking forward to? Or are dreading?
getting paid so i can get some new shoes. *shrugs* its not much but it helps.
What shoes are you getting?
some high tops hopefully.
Keanu Reeves is well deserving of the positive attention. Does anyone have a story to share?
We don't deserve Keanu. He is like the one guy on Earth that deserves dogs.
According to his movies, he might deserve them...but he's not allowed to keep them.
It‚Äôs just starting to feel like people are worshiping him
He's worthy, it's fine
I‚Äôm out of the loop. Why is he being mentioned so much lately?
I thought he was called Neil in the matrix when I first saw it.
I would give up my best friends life so keanu can live another day
My girlfriend killed my spider.
When I‚Äôm driving and someone‚Äôs making me mad, I always give them a thumbs up instead of a middle finger
I do the same thing but thumbs down. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.
I used to do the ‚Äúok‚Äù sign but the internet ruined that for me
It's ok to do the ok sign.
I blew a kiss once which confused the super aggressive bloke who was tailgating me.
I shake my fist at people. Like, Why, I oughta!
Craziest last 24 hours of my life
I‚Äôm not sure what to say...congratulations or that sucks or what
Yeah, I have no idea how to feel. My nerves are just shot at this point
I was gonna make a bad joke but screw it
Y‚Äôall about to get haunted now
That seems appropriate for some reason at this point
kind of seems insensitive to throw your neighbours suicide in with good news no?
My 8yo. daughter just asked me if I knew what a Human Centipede is.
Ok, who tf wrote that book. They knew.
Seriously. I immediately began to wonder what year this book was written.
It's a Judy Moody book. Before the movie.
so human centipede was a gritty remake of that book instead
how the turn tables
Why are you up?
Because it's 11:22am where I am
You're from the future???????????????
at the other side of the world, maybe? :)
Waiting for your post?
Post like letters or?
No, I mean this post from the OP, lol!
I am the OP
Oh, what's up?
Very little
little what?
Can‚Äôt sleep and I have to watch my cousins in the morning. Rip.
Are they really little?
2:39am. Put back out reaching for a plate. Good times
Sounds rough. I hate if when I mess my back up
Any tips on speeding up healing?
A hot shower usually does it for me
Sounds like a great idea!
And barring that, a hot bath with some Epsom salts
Ahh, yes. A nice long salty soak!
I asked my very traditional dad how he felt about the LGBTQ community, and he was such a sweetheart.
That's a good man right there
is that a destiny flair?
Good eye you have,  it definitely is.
auto riffles 4 ever
Lol, although I generally run scouts I'll take a good auto as well. Hard Light is my baby.
I'm guessing your Dad is a Sikh? If so, this doesn't surprise me at all
If your going to be hostile you can leave
And who the fuck are you?
Someone who isn't a homophobe
I'm also Indian and my dad is 100% a bigot
My mom isn't tho, which is cool
I'm down to 288 lbs
Good for you. Keep chopping wood.
Grinning like an idiot, cause a kid just made my day
I was off from work.  Yay! That's enough for me.
This is true.
I remembered to drink water on my own
No my weekend sucked
Sorry to hear that. Hope your upcoming week is much better!
Thanks,
But it won‚Äôt be lol
I lost 40 kg in a year!
What‚Äôs kg in freedom units aka pounds?
The NHS BMI calculator says that's a healthy weight. Good on you.
I did too. Though it dropped me to 28kg.
You gotta explain, did you loose 40 or 28 kg?
I dropped to weighing 28kg
Oh my, how is that possible? I hope you are okay, 28 kg is not healthy at all...
Thanks though :)
My song got over a 100 plays but 0 likes, does this mean I should quit song writing?
What service are you using to host it?
This is all on SoundCloud.
I randomly caught a documentary about how the human body is designed to perform better under a lack of food situation rather than an excess. I was skeptical but experimented on myself, and the results were immediate and shocking (in a very positive way).
If you managed to lose 20 kg, i am guessing you were overweight to beging with.
Today marks the first time someone has ever come to me and requested I autograph a birthday card for them
I want your autograph as well. Also happy birthday.
Note: this is very serious
Wholesome
Honestly sounds like a good way to make some easy money, kids love shit like that
I too can convince a child that *scribble E L S A scribble* is Elsa's real signature!
Why are you being unkind?
I‚Äôm making a joke about children, not being unkind. Why do you jump to ‚Äúunkind‚Äù so quickly?
Do you have one for Gastion?
Learned I‚Äôm the one ‚Äúwith all the cool sneaker‚Äù at work.
You should wear crocs one day just to see how much fashion power you have.
This is brilliant
Dont forget the socks for bonus effect
Toeless socks for the x2 bonus
or ones with individual toe places
Toe shoes make my soul hurt.
Sole* FTFY
I work in an industrial environment, and we have to wear steel toes :(
Had a really rough day today. Tell me about something positive that happened to you today.
I applied for my first job!! I‚Äôm very excited

My high school graduation was today

Are you a gayness?

Oh...that's a rainbow. Pride Month, right?
Well...enjoy yourselves, people.
Meh

Happy birthday though!
Thanks. Yeah I've seen a few memes about it. I can not claim that it is original :)
Haha true as the old saying goes. You made this?... I made this.
Any plans for today?
Hey! I turn 31 today! We are birthday buds! Happy Birthday!

My dad drove four hours from NYC to Boston to deliver me soup because I had a bad day
Fortunately for you, your contract wasn't renewed, so now you can move closer to your parents.
That‚Äôs actually the plan now :)
They're gonna be so thrilled!
Certainly a shorter distance to deliver soup! üòÇ
Unless you want your soup specifically from Boston.
This New York soup is not to my liking!
The warehouse soup tastes SO much better Michael.
Very sweet.
FYI:
Uber Eats or Door Dash would get it and deliver to you.
Your dad is an awesome dad! That brought a smile to my face!
Good luck to you in the future!
Psychology asserts that interacting with complete strangers can greatly boost your mood so stop scrolling and dammit interact with me :D
Average. Usual stresses along with a little joy here and there.
Okay, well then.
Do you like Mudkips?
What does non-binary mean ? I am trying to learn English. Does it mean night owl?
Just trying to keep it together. My bestfriend is in the hospital fighting for her life.
I recently started eating kiwi fruit with the skin on, and I have no regrets.
This is the craziest shit I've ever seen on Reddit. 
The skin is furry, you freak.
Have you ever eaten a peach?
As long as you wash it, it'll scratch any itches in/on your bumhole. 
No ragrets.
I am very sorry for judging overweight folks. I have changed now.
I don‚Äôt really care about health. Not like I want to live for 100 years or anything.
I need to complain about recreational cyclists, don‚Äôt downvote me too much...
Try being a driver in Denmark LOL. Then you‚Äôll really hate recreational cyclists.
Anyone else a loner and accept it?
Haven't accepted it no, I hate it. I don't do anything as a result. It's depressing.
I like being alone.
You like walking alone? Better try traveling alone. You learn so much of life.
Me too. I go hiking alone once or twice a month and it is always great.
Hiking sounds nice but I'm not fit enough to do it yet.
I'm very drunk right now
What field is your bachelor's degree in?
Nursing
Lmfao at nursing being the hardest degree you can get your bachelors in
Happiest drunk ever! Good for you! Best wishes on your boards and your wedding!
Thank you so much! Drunk me just says what sober me thinks, honestly
Sorry to hear about that
It's all good. We made up, but thank you
Yeah good to hear that
What did you get your bachelors degree in?
Nursing!
I'll think about drunk you next week during my physics exam! Cheers man!
Oh my God physics was my worst subject. I wish you the best of luck!
A drunk mind is a sober heart
Does anyone remember that Disney film, Atlantis: The Lost Empire?

My Hulu account was hacked a few months back, and I let it go because the people who were using it didn't change anything on it. They only watched stuff. And then this happened:
I bet that guy considers you the bad guy.
just because you are bad guy does not mean you are a bad *guy*
Who else will crush mans head between thigh like sparrow‚Äôs egg?
I loved reading this
I know right, smart guy, decent guy, nice guy even. But don't F#CK with that guy.
My account was hacked and had something similar and I also had an ‚ÄúAndy‚Äôs iPhone‚Äù lmao
Chaotic neutral?
Yooo
If someone have a spare netflix profile, i can guarantee you i wont change anything, ty.
Today is the anniversary of my 2017 suicide attempt. We're celebrating. Does anyone else have a reason to celebrate today?

Glad you are with us, and I know your boyfriend is glad too.
Congratulations. You deserve all the happiness that you have experienced and much more! xo
Well May 13th is the anniversary of me and my now wife starting to date.
That's exciting! May 13th, meaning it's already passed?
I have accidentally locked myself on my upstairs deck. My deck is full of WASPS. Chat with me in my final hours?

I havent drunk coffee in all of my 22 years of life until recently but now that Ive given it another go I feel AMAZING
That first cup in the morning amirite
That first five cups in the morning
Honestly makes me sleepy after I drink it. Dont know whats wrong with me...
Happened to me when i was younger. I think it was the warmth. Still makes me sleepy on occasion
Huh? I thought it was just me lol. 
For me it can be cold coffee too. Idk why its weird
Lol I have to say all my 22 years cracked me up. That is adorable.
Thats my whole life thankyouverymuch
If you think that‚Äôs incredible, you should try adderal.
Is does it give you more energy than coffee?
Today my marriage is old enough to drink. I love her so much.
Reading things like this makes me smile :) hope one day I can have a wife and love her this way
I'm in my mid-30s so I'm starting to think it's not going to happen. :\
34 here. What can we do besides keep truckin'?
For the record, my wife and I met when I was 35 and she was 29. This is my second go round.
My marriage is just about to start 5th grade.   We‚Äôve got a ways to go.

I got an A on an exam!
i'm proud of you. what was the class?
I finally get to eat protein! What should I eat first
Bacon. The answer is bacon
Bacon is one of the worst meats you can eat. Bad for cardiovascular health.
Tofu, of couse. Mix with soy sauce, stir fry it. So good.
Hell no
Hell yeah
Pizza &lt;3
A porterhouse.
A burger from Five Guys
please dont eat animals

I did the same thing with r/dankmemes and r/me_irl . I'm bored of edgy humor about suicide
Just the name enough internet scares me lol
How come I don't have access to these subs?
I went to see a movie alone. The girl, at least a decade younger than me, said she was missing out.
God damn. That would make me feel so good. Gl with your relationships.
Her loss? She dodged a manchild.
username checks out
What was his name
Sending big dick energy your way
Over here! (Waving frantically)
Movies *should* be a solitary experience. This stigma of going to cinemas alone must end!
Not much of a stigma for me. I love going to the movies alone. I prefer it.
What a shit title
Guys don't get complimented that often, but when we do it sticks.
You get her number?
Pretty neat how with just 2 words you can make (or ruin) someones day
right, imagine if she said yea I see why instead lmaoo
Pretty wild to say that to someone you‚Äôre about to sit next to for two hours.
Are you sure she didn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs missing out on the movie? Lol
Shhhhhh a teen would totally compliment an old dude
Maybe your date stood you up because you took her to FUCKING DETECTIVE PIKACHU
Guess she wasn't the girl for him then
Okay, so at best, she was 19, and you were 30?
Around there I think yeah.
We are talking about the seat-switcher, right? How old was your date?
I turn my AC down to 65 every night so my cat cuddles with me.

Either that's a lie or having a relationship is pointless
They kinda are, unless you want to make a brat.

Hello night owls, what do you do in your alone time?
Binge watch Youtube, play Skyrim, listen to music, drink cold brew coffee.
What do you watch on YouTube?
Stuff related to science, philosophy, technology and politics.

I usually listen to music or do some reading.
What do you read
I don't understand people who say they don't want to be stuck in a 9-5 cubicle job, it's the greatest thing in the world imo.
Get back to us in twenty years.
becoz 7-3 are waaaaaaaaaay better
Yeah, is this a new job? How long have you been working there?
Went out for dinner alone, happen to sit behind two people on a blind date. Cringe ensues. And yet happy ending.
Seems like they had the same sense of humor. Humor is really important!
That's a nice twist, from your title I thought it was going to end up awful for them

Nice team!
Thanks. I'm happy with how 'on theme' it was. Even if Goodra is totally useless.

Honestly yea. I need a hug or something.

I had to put my dog down yesterday and my heart just hurts too much right now
Sorry to hear about your loss a dog is truly a mans best friend.
Thank you, he was the best and the world is a little darker today without him
Not to replace him, but could you adopt another dog? It might replicate similar feelings
I'm so sorry for your loss.  There really is no love quite like the love from a dog. &lt;3

Have you ever thought of making a bed entirely out of pillows?
A cute guy talked to me in my apartment building

I legit never will again.
Did she become a millionaire by suing others?
Either that or sleeping with doctors
She was a millionaire and needed a roommate ?        
Maybe he was her 143rd roommate after she sued all the others for $7,000 each?
&gt;Satan can kiss my butthole.
I wouldn't let her.
So now do you get to sue her to recoup legal fees?
I didn‚Äôt spend any on legal fees, I couldn‚Äôt afford to. Had to rep myself.
How many bitches did she pay you??
How many bitches did you win?
A lawyer that lost the case...
#ironic.
Shouldn't there be a sub for this tipe of tenant hell stories?
I was wondering that when I posted myself! A few replies have shown some bad stories lol.

Your husband went through a lot of effort to find out your Reddit username.
Dont think the point had anything to do with finding out my username
This is so weird!  Why do you need to tell each other how you feel over the internet?  
God damn
Omg this is too cute for my heart to handle üò≠
Thank you :) I'm glad so many people like it
Are ya'll going to keep the same reddit accounts now?

Today, a man was drinking and blaring his vulgar music on a portable speaker in a packed train and I worked up the courage to ask him to stop that
Thank you 
Sincerely 
The other introverts of the world
Thank you. On behalf of everyone who‚Äôs ever been on a train in that situation.
lol at describing the music as vulgar
What's wrong with describing music as vulgar? Does vulgar music not exist?
Does Mr Brightside count as vulgar?
This sounds very British, OP are you British?
&gt;too vulgar to ignore
Grow the fuck up.
Ironic
No shit, Captain Obvious.
Seek help
HELP! I'M BEING ASSAILED BY AN ABSOLUTE MORON ON REDDIT!

Truly pitiful
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're doing your best and that's all that matters. =D
Morality police in full force that's what it is.
I did this once on a bus, the guy showed me his gun and, thus, he won.

No. I find it unpleasant.
I tried showering in the dark, and I love it
But then the monsters can get you.....
I know how it feels and yes, is so relaxing, but usually I put a candle so I can see a little.
Now try the shower while you sit down in the dark.... I love that
My FAVOURITE thing, especially when I have a bad hangover lol

How was it on the moon?
I just joined this sub and I'm curious what the average demographic is here, so tell me whatever you're comfortable saying about yourself.
Mid 20s, cyber sec, hates Tuesdays more than mondays.
Hmm..care to elaborate on the Tuesday thing?
Mondays are my short days, Tuesdays not so much.
Makes sense. I have Mondays off. By the way, what does go flyers mean?
Philadelphia Flyers, favorite hockey team!
Ah okay, but how did you get it by your name?
I unknowingly became friends with a drug kingpin, and his outlook on life and such changed my personal views and the way I thought.
This is so wholesome. I hope you're both doing well with yourselves.
Thanks, I‚Äôm doing better than ever! Hope youre doing good too
Plot twist: OP is the kingpin
Holy shit dude you were friends with NoHo Hank
I don't really get why so many people love The Office
I only watched it for the girl with the huge knockers.
Now I'm just wondering what this means...
What are your plans for this weekend ?
Nada. Clean, read, write, perhaps go to the gardens or for a drive.
Yea, I mean its something to do at least.
I‚Äôm also working on a quilt for charity
I'm 32 years old, and I'm still grateful that I don't have to do homework.

You sir... you deserve some gold. I wish I could give you some
I've already got some, friend! No need to worry!
Oh, hooray!
Want some silver?
Oh, you are too kind! I can't accept! üòä
Keep it for something you find that deserves it!
I have never downvoted anyone. I‚Äôm a people pleaser
I lost my parents to illness and i really just want to talk about them
Where were your parents born? Where did they grow up?
At 7:30 this morning I deployed out of a helicopter into 15-20ft seas and saved three people and a dog.

Thunderstorms are amazing.
I play thunderstorm sounds on my phone the entire time I‚Äôm asleep, every night.
I would sleep with you anytime.
THAT WHENT FROM 0 TO 100 REAL QUICK
I‚Äôm simply saying that I would sleep with them. I sleep well with those sounds.
I know, it just sounds like something... else
I created a chat
Today I saw an introvert trying to step out of his comfort zone
Good guy OP nice job lookin out for humanity
Thank you, u/NeckbeardVirgin69
And people say alcohol can't solve anything. Pssh
Not in my city - people would walk over your cold corpse before talking to you
Why do you type out every word except rly?
Your grammar gives me a headache.
Possibly unpopular statement but introverts don't necessarily need fixing
my friend asked me if i had ever had a girlfriend
You go mah duuude.
Party on, and be excellent.
Party on and be excellent. I love this. Makes me feel all warm and 90‚Äôs.
Tbh when I feel like I'm in the 90's it's usually not a positive feeling but I agree with you
Oh man the 90s were kind of the good old days when you still had to keep your mouth shut
I think he's making a joke, as in he feels 90 years old?
Oh no I meant 1990-1999
......
Yes I'm aware of what you were doing. I'm telling you he was making a joke.
Good for you! Be yourself.
ur a dude or a girl?
Wow that‚Äôs so good!! Surround yourself with people that accept who you are
it made me so happy &lt;3
I sincerely wish you continue to be happy :)
Sorry, I'm confused - what gender are you?
Any luck catching someone?
That's not good. You're supposed to only like Girls.
Redditors, let's play a game!
I have eidetic(photographic) memory 
I'm an orphan
Because the two others are oddly specific, #2 seems like the fake one
I wish i had 1, but that's false
Now you have to tell me about your memory. How do you use it ?
i speak french
i have french citizenship
i have been to France
You haven‚Äôt been to France right ?
wrong, i dont have citizenship
Oh, you‚Äôre an expat ?
I've had brain surgery
I don't have wisdom teeth.
I'm allergic to peanuts.
You aren‚Äôt allergic to peanuts ?
Correct
My daughter's first experience in a Uber.
I have never and will never use an Uber.
I find that cabbies tend to be minorities from out of the country, I like that.
Took ~20 uber in my life, and all of them except 1 ! were from north Africa.
That has changed. A lot of uber drivers are minorities now.
Maybe. But Texas isn‚Äôt very diverse.
Tell her to only get into cars with strangers when she's with you or when you tell her.
I have homework due in an hour so hmu
What kind of homework is it?
Calculus, end my suffering.
Oh, jeez. Lol. Hope it wasn't too hard. I suck HARD at math and whatever has numbers in it.
Have you ever wondered what those things at the end of a shoelace are called?
What are you all up to right now?
I started watching the second season of Stranger Things, and now am peeing
Laying in bed trying to go to sleep but I can‚Äôt get this girl off my mind
Is she a friend? Co-worker?
Woman stopped next to me at a red light yelled at me to tell me I'm beautiful.
It's wonderful when woman lift each other up üíú
The world needs more women like this!
lemme guess, if a man did the exact same thing you'd be either weirded out or just tell him off.
Imagine crying about having acne, oof
Anyone else love autumn time?
Yeah, i love the winter more but autumn is nice
Sweater season!!!!!!!
I have a rare disorder called distichiasis.
Hmm, the most interesting thing about me... I published a Slovak cookbook.
Wow! Congratulations. Which dish was your favourite?
I have a bifid uvula.
Honestly, I‚Äôm drunk right now and have never ever posted on this sub and I just wanna talk to some people about totally random topics. So ask some completely random questions and I‚Äôm down to answer whatever you wanna know!
Hard to my momma‚Äôs pancakes and French toast. I‚Äôm a sucker for some good pancakes.
French toast sounds so good rn
My mom was declared cancer free but I come here with a PSA
Very important advice
Going now
I'm so self conscious of my breath it smells alot...
Honestly good advice, but I'm here for a good time not a long time
Won't be that good of a time with a preventable illness.
I wont live long enough to get any illnesses tbh.
I really can‚Äôt afford to see a doctor
Sorry to be blunt but funerals ain't cheap either.
Its cheaper than what it cost for me to take a 5 mile trip in an ambulance to the hospital
Just had mine removed in the last week. So fucking lucky it was caught early.
Does everyone here has a SO?
I don‚Äôt 
But I am 14
Yes.  Met in HS.  Got married many yrs later
I make love to your sister
What the hell does SO even mean?
My friends called me famous for having two followers on Twitter, they are the two followers

Nice, don't do it ever again lol
My toddler saw a turtle and, without prompting, called it a ‚Äúterradoom.‚Äù And I‚Äôm not sure that I want to correct him.
Terradoom sounds like a turtle-based Pok√©mon name to be completely honest haha.
Post to /r/rimworld 
Dont ask why, would take to long and make us sound weird, just go with it.
Not asking why, but just make this exact text post there?
I‚Äôm not against it.
I stood up for a lady on the bus a few weeks ago and pissed off the guy that was harassing her
Thank you for choosing solidarity.
[Tylko je≈õli pochodzƒÖ ze sma≈ºonymi ziemniakami lub kurczakiem. (Dziƒôki Google t≈Çumacz)]
Tldr pls???
Did she continue to ride the bus?
We got off together at the next stop :) it was a stop early for me but I don't mind
No did she come back the next day and thereafter?
Just got an amazing job offer. I've doubled my salary in two years. Oh and I'm a high school dropout with no degree.
Hey, that‚Äôs awesome! Congratulations!
Thank you so much I'm honestly still in shock. Thank you for commenting!
Congrats man .....
You did it, and I'm proud of you. We all are.
Congrats! Hope the job is worth it. What is the job out of curiosity?
Hard work doesn't pay off but sometimes you get lucky
You're entitled to think that, but I respectfully disagree.
Can I ask why you dropped out of high school? Not to be rude just curious. I dropped out as well
What did you go from 100 dollars a year to 200
Well done lad!
Lass* and thank you!
Am I the only one who loves thunderstorms?
Thunderstorms are pretty common to enjoy/admire.

Just eggs.  I'm on a budget and I can get a 60 egg box for 5 bucks at Walmart
Day 1 no smoking :/
Well done!!!!!! Keep up the amazing work. You‚Äôre a rock star.
If it makes you feel any better you already did the hardest part.
Hope you made it through the day!
Life is really great when you don't have high expectations.
It's all fun and games until there's kids and then your bills get huge.

I pretend to be happy.
Yuppppp.  I also pretend to have my life together.
Sometimes I daydream about being a aerial killer also.
I just called my Grandma and when she answered the first thing she said was, well isn't this my lucky week??
My grandparents and anyone elderly I knew growing up are dead and have been for a while.
I haven't talked to my grandma for years LOL
Damn, I really dislike Ross
Who?
That guy from friends
Rachael should‚Äôve ended up with Joey.
I just made the best burger of my life.
So whatd you put on said smash burger?

My neighbour is flying a skull and crossbones flag on a flagpole in his front yard and it‚Äôs just weird
Tampa Bay fan?
Perhaps. Although I‚Äôm in Australia
It's probably meant tongue-in-cheek. He may have recently become a fan of pirates.
I just learned what see you not if I see you first means
Oh my gosh! I never knew this. Although it makes so much more sense now.
... Whelp. TIL.
Yeah, English is a funny and weird language at times as a Seond-English speaker
I didn't know until this very second.
I always interpreted it as enthusiasm. üòÇ
That's what I thought! I thought it was more like see you! Back at ya!
Is Downtown Abbey good?
I saw the trailer and I want to see it now but I guess I have to wait
Two songs that define you
Yes I'm Changing - Tame Impala
Femme Fatale - The Velvet Underground
So I fired one of my employees &amp;...
Most of time people fire themselves, the boss just makes it official.
Could only ever wish for an employer with the handle of butt_salamander
We all have our proclivities lol
&gt; Talking to his fans
Wait, what? Also, how old was he?
He's in his mid 30's. He can tell his fans now that he was promoted from employee to customer.
What Fans dose a (former) forklift driver (who still lives with his parents?) have?
His fans?
Also, who brings mommy in to work to help fix a problem?  Guy sounds like a loser.
Just had to make it 100 comments
I really like your attitude :)
Is his job available?
Thank you, Im serious. What state are you located?
You replied to yourself not OP

Congratulations!! It's a huge step forward and super fun. What's your major?
Who else here loves music a lot?
Do you play any instruments?
I play acoustic, piano, and songwrite. I do raps too but just for fun, nothing serious.

I have them all and I am autistic but that's unrelated
Get it now, just do it
I‚Äôm going to call right on Monday when they‚Äôre open!
What‚Äôs your dad‚Äôs reasoning for opposing them?
Mainly cause he think they cause autism and that crap, ugh
My kid has decided she is not ready for a pet yet and I think its great
I would be incredibly proud too. This is a very responsible decision.

My 2YO daughter said I love you for the first time

Please ask blind/disabled people if they want help before helping them.
Does that happen often? I can‚Äôt how much it would suck.
It hasn‚Äôt happened to me that much but it does suck when it does.
What do you see? What do you dream?
I don‚Äôt remember my dreams and see light and shadows.
Thank you, sounds scary do you have a lot of friends?
how did you write this when you're blind?
Just curious
I think a lot of people just really want to be heroes
Maybe but they still should ask and if we say no, listen to us.
How are you typing and reading?
Using the Screen reader on my phone.
Sorry for the late reply, I just read your response.
Wait, how did you write this
My physiotherapist fixed my malpositioned lumbar vertebra. It caused me pain for YEARS and made my life miserable.
the same thing happened to me, 10 yrs of misery gone in an instant
I want to make a story with y'all.
When I woke up this morning I couldn't see.
I rubbed my eyes and stumbled out of bed, hitting a table and hurting my knee.
After hopping around on one foot I felt something wet, it was pee.
You wouldn‚Äôt believe what happened last night
Aliens visited my house!
I know it sounds crazy, but I have proof- let me show you
They left their burrito wrappers all over my lawn.
And then a fluffy cat licked the burritos.
The cat reacted to the alien burritos in a strange way.
It became an alien itself!
And that's how my cat got deported.
That was my evidence for you, but now I have this for you instead
It's a cupcake, you deserve it.
*person #2:* thanks! But what does this have to do with aliens?
Guys, I want to pet a duck SO fucking bad.
This is an achievable goal.
You have to get a baby chick at the same time, but it has to be a rooster chick
Don't let this distract you from the fact that ducks are serial rapists
Yeah but they have little wingies so
Let‚Äôs make this ducking happen!
I raised ducks. Can confirm it‚Äôs a very nice experience, until they shit on your lap.
Mmm bro... duck have small IQ than cat and dog :o
What are you some kinda bird brain?
Shoutout to everyone who‚Äôs been making progress that no one recognizes because theyre not things you typically mention to others.
Thanks mate. 45 days clean off heroin but I can't tell anyone. Needed that.
I can only imagine how hard that is, mad respect for you! Keep it up :)
Kia ora bro. I appreciate that and I will.
For someone who's visiting NZ at the end of this year that was cool to read :)
I‚Äôm over here doing a little happy dance for you. Legit.

Wait what how did you do that
I went to the cinema alone for the first time today, it was fucking amazing‚ò∫Ô∏è
It's one of the best experiences because you have no one to bother you or talking to you.
Totally agree! Thinking of buying myself a monthly cinema pass and doing it more often
Bravo, welcome to the club. Soon you'll prefer all kinds of stuff alone ü§£
Huzzah! We surpassed 777,777 subscribers!

So next goal is 999,999 and 1000,000, right?
Why are six infinity glyphs not enough for you?!

Gotta be a Bungie dev.

Congrats dude or gal, happy to hear that
Partner asked me to move in!
Glad for ya, I‚Äôm still waiting to find my someone :), wish you two the best!
You mean boyfriend? Or do you two own a business together?
There are some downsides tho. For instance, you gotta hold in your farts again...
Umm doubt it
This is r/casualconversation not r/congratslikeimfive
How tall is he?
Nobody I know cares. But I need to tell somebody.
Ah ledge pal! Congratulations! Have you set a rough date? You must be buzzing üòä

Just donated bone marrow today to save a stranger‚Äôs baby. There is a serious lack of available donors, especially for people of color.

I (20 F) went bra shopping for the first time in a few years and need to talk about my experience.

I‚Äôm guy who just went through a breakup and this is making me cry.
Haha cute! I hope I'll have something like that someday. :)

How‚Äôd you meet him?
Your happiness sickens me.

There's a sub for just about *everything* :)
That's why I love Reddit, you're bound to find a sub that's perfect for you XD
I know! And, if you can't find it, you can make it! ü§£

Cold, going to the south

Warm warm
1:05 here in Toronto. Try and guess what show I'm watching.
I (F) grew up rural and was always intimidated when going to The Big City. I felt ‚Äònot good/cool enough‚Äô. Now I work in Times Square NYC, and every time I see someone with ~that~ look on their face, I compliment their outfit. I can tell by their smiles that it makes them feel good
You are the best type of person. Good on you. We need more of this in all our lives.
Aw thanks!
Not all heroes wear capes!
You‚Äôre awesome!
YOU are awesome as well, my friend. Also, that icon, does that mean it‚Äôs your cake day?
Well you are a totally awesome human being
Thank you. I‚Äôm sure you are too (and would love to hear about it)
You're very welcome. And I'm pretty sure I'm not
I am gonna try doing this too. Thanks for the idea. You are a kind person.
YOU THAT EVERYDAY HERO!
You are the best!
 Have you ever watched Black Mirror series?
No smoking for almost a month
That's awesome. Keep it up B.C. the longer you smoke the harder it'll be to have that will power
Consider yourself a non-smoker! I quit in 1999, and I never looked back.
Let's chat Reddit 3: Rise of the Me Me's
Do I say a meme? Or say anything in general? I‚Äôm not understanding :( but I‚Äôm bored too.
Whatever you want, I just put that title as a reference to Rise of Machines
You still there
Anybody up for a chat about anything? Having a bad mental day and would love to just talk!
I would love to talk as well. I don't have too much time though. But we can chat for a while...
What are you off to go to relatively soon? Anything interesting?
And where are you from?
I'm in Indiana currently. From a little bit of everywhere as I'm a military Brat.
Military brat? What is that?
I was born into a military family.
I accidentally flashed a group of people at a coffee shop today
You brightened up the day for a few of those coffee drinkers.
Unless she weighs 600lbs
Can we just quit calling women females?
Nobody says females except on Reddit.
I hear men at work say it occasionally. Or should I say males
Imo female sounds cute
I can't think of a context where it would. Could you give me one?
Not in a specific scenario tho
I just graduated High School!
Rock on!!! I went back to college at 40, so I relate to finishing late! :D
Congrats ! Planning to go to college after that ?
I'm gonna join the Army. I'll try and do online school while I'm there.
I heard the USAF likes people with a &gt;3.5 GPA.
Yeah, but they are hard to get into because they have more recruits than they have positions.
What's a GPA?
3.7
Bought my first flannel yesterday. I‚Äôve been hugging it and covering myself with it almost every hour of the day. What‚Äôs your clothing represent?
Wait do people think im gay because i wear flannel?
Scarves. I love them, and I have plenty. I try to wear them every time I can.
I got 4 days off in a row from work and it‚Äôs the most exciting feeling
Gift yourself a binge-watch session of some really good movies.
Oh yeah! What movies??
Watch over the garden wall. Perfect length and great story.
I‚Äôll check it out!
Watch The Shining for its isolation element. It'll tie in with you being home from work!
Day drink! It's so liberating cracking open a cold one at 10am
Give yourself a hot bath. 
And an ice cream later. :p
I just popped a 3+ year old zit and it feels amazing
I hope its just zit and nothing else
r/popping wants u!
I don‚Äôt want to click. But I really do.
This whole sub should be marked as NSFW! Especially that post with a horse...
Omg, I had no idea this existed. THANK YOU
One of us, one of us, one of us

I‚Äôve got cystic acne and I‚Äôve had this small one on my chin for at least 9 years.
Use a thumb tack
I would take a knife to it.
Dude just go to a dermatologist next time, blech
Too expensive for some. American healthcare system and all.
Getting a cyst popped doesn‚Äôt cost much
Popping it yourself is free
I ate watermelon for the first time and can't believe what I've been missing.
Bro my best friend is allergic to watermelon. This gives me hope for him
I don't like watermelons, but I feel happy for you
What dont you like about watermelons? You might have tried a bad one or a expired one.
I don‚Äôt like watermelon either. Something about the texture. But agreed, happy for OP.
Wait so how old are you again??
I was just at Costco and I heard a kid say the sweetest thing.
That's adorable.
My heart melted a little.
This moment is so sweet, i could put it in a cup of tea.
Wait until one dumps him for his friend
Just paid off my first car...feeling very proud and didn‚Äôt have anyone else to tell
Hey congratulations! Here‚Äôs to many more accomplishments!
Im proud of ya!
I‚Äôm fighting my stutter!
Good luck. Remember your silent h's.
Samuel L. Jackson cured his stutter with the word ‚Äúmotherfucker‚Äù
You go boy!!!!!!
You'll get through it! Much love
Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt even tell.
Just a joke, meaning couldn‚Äôt tell you had a stutter by reading your post.
When I read your post I don't hear any stuttering bro. You are fine.
What do you mean you don‚Äôt hear any stuttering?
My book was purchased by a library!
Congrats love! üíï
Ill try and read it sometime,it sounds great!
Thank you very much! It would be much appreciated!
Lets talk about lofi hiphop beats

I've never felt more out of place than a Subaru service waiting room
Which Subaru?
Do you believe in the japanese quote that everybody have 3 faces ?
O guess it‚Äôs the same thing as the other trio: ego, superego and id.
I think that third mask shows up on social media a lot.
I dont believe in it because there is only one place on your body to put a face
I just picked my nose with my bare finger and I don‚Äôt show that face to anyone so yeah
the most shameful face
I bought weed for the first time today!
I turned 21 last weekend and finally bought legal weed ‚úå Great time.

Honestly are you Ryan in from the office?
To be fair Ryan probably went from 18k/year to six figures
I think I got my coworker fired.
what a dick move. i despise people like you.
Funny, I despise people who lie for their own personal gain. How odd.
. _. you got something to tell to me?
I have schizophrenia!
What kind of words would you see on the wall?
I saw the word wait and ocean a lot. That‚Äôs the only words I could make out.
I made it into med school!
Congrats! Hope all goes well in med school, and glad you pulled through to get your Phd :)
Awesome! I want to go to med school to be a surgeon
Onya mate!
Congratulations, future doctor (PhD and MD)! Out of curiosity what are you studying in your PhD?
Today I found out my house spider Tom cheated on me.
Tom doesn't deserve you. Time to hit the gym and delete your Facebook.
Don't forget to hire a private detective and lawyer up!
And be sure to get tested as well!
I'm trying to come up with a spidery STD pun and failing miserably.
Tom is not a spider. Tom is an opilion.
My best friend called me after 3 months and it felt really good
I finally know what motherfucker means in Hindi.Thank you
Madarchod
Pronunciation by chance? I‚Äôm going with Ma-Dar-Kod and I know I‚Äôm wrong haha
Maa-Dar-chowd.
It's more like Maa-Dar-Chowed
Ma, the chode
MA! THE FUCKIN' CHODE IS BACK!
Or simply ‚ÄúMother-chowed‚Äù
That‚Äôs quite a greeting lol
It's quite common in India. Mostly among boys
Among bros

A male supervisor asked me if it was okay to hug me!
This is very wholesome. Glad you could have such a nice experience.

r/rimjob_steve
Your username makes me uncomfortable, ever so slightly.
Look what you've done.
People are sending you death threats over this post!?!? Wow!
You seem like someone worth hugging. ^^
I ate a bowl of oatmeal this morning and i never had so much energy for my 8 hour work/ school day today and I‚Äôm so shook that I didn‚Äôt get headaches.
This has inspired me to eat a bowl of oats tomorrow morning.
Do it ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è
Idk I feel like this post is just Big Oat trying to gain some free advertising

Congratulations here‚Äôs your adult card üí≥
I found a USB key in an Elementary School playground and its contents shocked me
She's going to post about it on Reddit in another few years and the story will go viral.
I‚Äôll be glad to finally hear back from that, it crosses my mind now and then ..
That's one way to get a Trojan.
Yeah, you gotta open that on a school computer
That title very much concerned me. Then I read it
Title is soooo click baity
I just got a scholarship for the best university in my country and I'm on the freaking moon right now.
Kudos to you! What‚Äôs your major?
Computer Science!
Which school? And where is this? I really want to study CS as well
Naming the school will probably give away too much info about OP
All that would tell us is their nationality
We could probably use their credit card number as well. For security.
Congrats! What‚Äôs the uni man?
It‚Äôs Harvard
How do you know this?
I didn't know they had a university on the moon!  Congrats !
It's a great university but it lacks an atmosphere to be honest.
Invited my quite college acquaintance for a dinner. Never seen him happier
Thanks for doing that. I would have loved something like that during college!
If I knew who you were and was with you, I could have done it, for sure :) !
I stopped killing spiders in my home
That‚Äôs cute
Today I was stalked by a guy in the dollar store...
How tired did he look because I was so exhausted every time I've done this.
&gt;every time
How many times has this happened to you, lol?
At least once
I had my first pineapple on pizza and I blame all of the internet for making me think it tastes awful
Pineapple and ham pizza is where it's at. Just saying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Go to r/KnightOfPinapple
oh nice another cult to follow x)
its delicious, fuck the haters
Now you need to try anchovies &amp; pineapple.
isn't it super salty? I tried anchovies and it was so salty I drank more than I ate
The pineapple offsets it. :)
Move them together so they're in the same mouthful.
Want an upvote and a compliment?
I'm not sure what I need to hear today.
You matter. Seriously
no im going to compliment YOU nice username
Haha, you are a model of thoughtfulness and good will.
that was so nice i feel outdone
You deserve it!
YOU deserve it !!
I love u
Thanks for being you. Your eyes are beautiful, kind, and wise.
I adore you for having the patience and energy for this. Thanks in advance :)
You literally make every situation you are a part of better.  It's remarkable.
Hey, I had avocado fries with dinner. Great username.
I love your smile and the way you throw yourself into projects.  Very endearing combo :-)
Well, I'm curious to see what'll happen, so here's a comment.
You are a wonderful listener. There's not too many like you around. Thank you.
And thank you for replying.
Ask me something and then edit the question after I've answered to make me seem crazy.
What got you into animation?
A hamster!
Wow you‚Äôre a real sicko!
Hahaha. It tastes just like chicken.
What's the most unique meal you've ever cooked?
I've cooked a really nice cajun chicken dish with quinoa.
What programming language is your favorite?
Where was your favorite place to travel?

Feeding the baby and scrolling through Reddit...
Seen anything interesting while scrolling?
Yeah, someone was asking why testicles are hairy
I‚Äôm in the couch having a lazy day because I‚Äôm sick. Planning on gaming the whole weekend

Happy Anniversary!
‚ù§Ô∏èüéâüéäüéà
That shir is hard to qiit for a long time how did you do it
Congratulations. It‚Äôs well worth it. My stop date was December 31, 1978.
I ran my first 5k but my family wasn't happy for me
Congratulations!!!!!
Thank you very much I ran it in just under 40 minutes
Awesome! That‚Äôs a really good time for a first 5k!
Really?  I googled it and it said it was under average unfortunately
5k in 40 minutes is insane for your first run! Great job!
Wouldn't say insane, but it's not a bad starting point! Still great work :)
Fuck ya!!!
Great job! I hope to be able to run a 5k. This has inspired me to reinstall couch to 5k.
Your family sounds like assholes. Congrats on your first 5k though
Well this stranger is very proud of you and if you can do it so can I ! (I think ü§î)
Way to go!!!
Describe your music tastes with one song - and one song only

Nice, thanks!
5 years ago today, I escaped an abusive home.
Good shit my guy.
I watched the world around me wake up
And then you got mugged by gangbangers?
I do this every day, up by 2:30 to be at work by 4am
Nothing like getting off work and realizing you have half the day left!
Yes, have been enjoying my 12:12 finish time. Changing shifts next month: 5:15am until 1:10pm

I just saw a young woman running to class and spill all her books. A young man helped her and they picked up same book at the same time and locked eyes. She blush, muttered a thank you and kept going but they both turned back to share one last glance.
I need to know what happens next!  You have to track them down and do a follow up!
Anyone else got a weirdly varied music taste?
I'd say it's weirder if you're actually a music lover and you only listen to one genre of music.
Ok, now that everyone knows that the amazon rainforest is on fire, what should we actually be doing about it?
There's plenty of posts with donating links,donste to the cause.
What do they do? Put water on it? Sand?
I hugged my girlfriend today.

Get used to it. Birthdays are for kids. Get over it.
I just deleted all of my social media(besides the best one;) and got rid of all of the toxic people in my life.
Facebook free for 7 years. I highly recommend it
Get rid of reddit too, it‚Äôs just as toxic and much more...cringey
And some how this turn in to a political post... And I lost my interest
Do you ever feel like crying purely to relieve stress?
I can‚Äôt make myself cry ever. :/ I‚Äôm just stuck in a cycle of non-emotionalness.
no wonder with that grammar
My wife‚Äôs friend group recently dumped one of their own members because her weight issues were starting to ruin their group photos on Instagram. Is this a new thing now?

I love Americans, but I'm so sick of America being central to all the media I consume.
We're all living in America, America, ist wunderbar ...
I‚Äôm from Sweden and 80%~ of the state funded televised news are from the Middle East.
This doesn‚Äôt seem very nice, maybe /r/unpopularopinion is a better subreddit for it?
Start a European production company lol.
Have you seen Dark? Its a german serie and I really recommend watching it.

üëç from Australia
Hope it's resolved in favour of the people!
Thank youuuu &lt;3
I‚Äôm shocked how some redditers think that this all protest is fake.

That just means you get to take yourself out again!
Would really appreciate talking to some kind people
Don't really have any passions, but up to chat about anything
I ran a mile
Congratulations dude keep it up!
Cheez-its. Yay or nay?
They are good but after you eat so many they are not desirable anymore
Maybe for you, but for me, they only become more desirable.

Think of it like a hot tub, you sit, pee and soak. What more could you ask for?
...pee?
You can also wash children and dogs in them.  Cats not recommended.

One of my friends told me he always likes talking to me because of one thing I do and it made me so happy
That's lovely. Simple things!
I do this sometimes too, and it's really effective. But it's hard to do it sincerely sometimes.
You should consider teaching, coaching, or mentoring. We can always use great people like you.
Who wants to play detective?
Is the boat transporting secret cargo?
Was the boat used to go to the Carribean?
Was the boat purchased from a shady source/person?
So, was the 'contest' real?
Does the seller of the boat know Oscar personally?
This may sound like the most stupid question but is the contest reward real?
The reward was real, yes
Does the so-called seller's gang operate in the island?
Is Oscar in danger?
Possibly but irrelevant
Is Oscar directly involved in this 'crime'?
Other than drugs, are they any other contraband on the boat?
And does Oscar know about em?
There is no other contraband and Oscar does not know about it
Does the 'boss' operate in the island by any chance?
Was the previous owner a supplier of drugs?
Was the previous owner's job only to get the drugs, on the boat, into innocent hands?
Does the boss own or work within the resort?
Were the drugs intended to actually be received by someone when the boat arrived at the island?
Was the resort acting as a distribution hub for drugs?
Was the *island* a distribution point?
I just want to talk to someone
Hey, nice to meet you! I‚Äôd love to chat until my friend wakes up :p

Just got an email from a mom I used to nanny for when I was in college. Her teenage son just complained about Dino checked nuggets. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt taste like they used to, and there are no Dino eggs!!!‚Äù
This is so ridiculously wholesome. You'll make a great mom someday if you're not already.
When is dinnertime at your house my new bestie? Can I come!?
Absolutely!
This is the purest post I've till today.

Heartbreaking? LMFAO dude get over yourself.
Who cares about upvotes though?
Me :/
And you care about downvotes why?

But yes, I definitely agree.

I think hugs are necessary....they are magic.
Countless scientific studies agree with you. The power of human touch is amazing.
Would that make our skin amazing?
üòäüòäüòäüòäthank you for this beautiful information. I'm glad to know!
Pfft... There's nothing more magical than a good b***job. Other than that I don't feel nothing.
All of us huggers need to make a subreddit lol (unless there already is one?)
Man I haven't been hugged since I was a kid.
Serial hugger here. Hugs *are* magic. 
Keep up the good work!
I see you, seeing me, seeing you, seeing me!
Less seeing, more hugging!

It‚Äôs funny how a random interaction with a stranger can have an affect on you. Just got a random compliment in the food court of my local mall and I can‚Äôt stop beaming. As a guy, I rarely get one of these.
It's pink not salmon, Ross
But did u get her number ?
Nope, missed connection üòÜ She is slightly out of my age range.
Age is just a number

Feeling lost and maybe finally finding your way.
Could you write me a poem about the construction of a pizza ball
I need a poem about how everything is ok even when things go wrong
The complexity of everything.
I'd love one. Feeling pretty sapped from an emotional break up.
I feel the need to brag
I bet you're on some sort of list. haha.
Shut up, Donald
My social media goal is to get Taylor Swift to follow my cats' Instagram account.

I don‚Äôt SING them. Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty dumb.
I finally told the girl I was talking to that I like her.

Dad: you're pretty
Keanu Reeves: *you're pretty!*
Sex Offender: You're Pretty.
Me whilst running away: YOURE PRETTY!

Why would you answer after 21 days
Been playing Apex Legends and Pokemon Shield.
I love battle royales and nostalgia.
My sense of smell just came back after five years. What's your favourite smell? I want to experience it!
I love the smell of the air after a rainstorm in the summer and fresh baked cookies.

Blooming lilacs are my favourite smell.
Good ol‚Äô marijuana.  Burning or not.

Girlfriends grandmother is a great artist and has many pieces like this, today she shared her first.
I mean thats downright astounding.
Does she draw for a living or is it just a hobby?
Is this a portrait of a specific person? It looks really good
When I was 7 I had these purple converse with rainbow laces. I was bullied and people called me and my shoes gay. I went home crying and never wore them again. Now I am an out proud queer woman and my parents bought me these for me to wear with pride
Sounds like the bullies had you figured out.
i feel like seven year olds would associate rainbows with just being rainbows and not lgbt
oh dear.
I should say the same about your obsession with Taylor Swift‚Äôs legs.
You clearly can't appreciate true beauty.
Again....Oh dear.
‚ÄúYou clearly can't appreciate true beauty.‚Äù
Absolutely correct. Taylor Swift is a fucking goddess.
Dude wtf I'm jealous. I want those shoes. So dope.
You should check out the psychucks you can totally customize them now, remake those shoes!
wait I can't find what you're talking about üò≠ can you post a link?
Ugh I think they were limited time, you can still make custom ones thoughüôÉ

My SO, who loves art, finally painted something (inspired by a photo) I‚Äòm so proud of her, I think she has great potential!
Hey that's how I sign things!!
Me too.. Well this is awkward.
This what your shadows be doing when they‚Äôre not following you, meeting up and dancing
Can you ask your SO what was she trying to share ? It seems so eerie (in a good way )
To me it looks like people dancing, what do you think? :)
What app or software did she use for this?
Damn it has so much soul, I'd love to hang this somewhere in my home!
Happy to help out a stranger in Starbucks yesterday morning
I have been in her situation so many times, I wish someone like you had shown up to save me.
Just a fake bragging sub at this point
Just managed to run 5k in under 23 minutes for the first time (military requirement in the Netherlands)
Congratulations x
Thanks! Really happy about it
That‚Äôs awesome. My personal best is 23:50. Any tips for training or just keep pushing?
Run downhill.
x?
It's used to convey tone, usually friendly.
As someone who finds myself moderately got and managed to run 1.61 km, im impressed!
Dude congrats
It takes me like 35 mins to finish a 5K
Some day it will take you 34
Some day it will take you 33

What app is that mate?
After nearly 3 years of being too anxious to complete any artwork, I finally finished a painting! I'm genuinely proud of it, which I didn't think I could be! I just wanted to share this small victory with someone.
Holy crap! How long you been doing this?
It's annoying when people assign gender to hobbies and things people like.
Or age! I knit and I'm 30. I'm teased for being a Grandma.

Hi! Have you ever tried watching ASMR videos? They helped me a lot!
They give me goosebumps, can't watch them
Well kinda that's the point, but in a non creepy way...
I stand by my statement now and forever: putting away clean laundry is one of the most boring household tasks ever
I'm procrastinating that very chore by scrolling through reddit right now.
Fresh sheet night is a great night!
It‚Äôs my birthday and I‚Äôll probably end up spending it alone because people forget about it lol
Happy birthday!  I‚Äôm going to have a cupcake in your honor today.

Happy birthday mate, mine was yesterday ! Almost everyone forgot as well haha
I turned 50 today. I feel your pain.

I used to, but not so much anymore. My name is Alexa.
Being closeted trans. I hate my name being used. :(
Is it just me, or was Christmas kinda off this year?
Yeah Christmas was shit
I‚Äôm so excited for tomorrow, simply for the fact that I won‚Äôt have to listen to Christmas music anymore
I think it continues till the sales  end
I work at Lowe‚Äôs and. It gets pretty annoying specially when you get the song stuck in your head

To everyone feeling lonely tonight
Appreciate the thought, but it really does nothing for me. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel less alone.
What do you need, right in that moment?
Does anyone else get lonely and when they finally go out and socialise with friends, you just regret going out?
I do when those friends are shitheads
I just stopped a carjacking
You gonna lock your doors now?
Didn't get much of a choice in the matter since I can't reach the door lock from my seat

My friends and I are in our 20's. We were recently in a candy store and getting super excited about all the candy and trying to decide which ones to buy. An elderly woman, perhaps around 90, came up to us and told us how happy she was to see how you young adults have not lost your inner child.
This is so precious!

My coworker eats lemons with salt
That's a southern US thing. It's degree of strangeness is proportional to where you come from.
Thanks for the idea
I ate lemons with salt all the time in my youth.
After 4 long months of continuous survival in a shelter, loosing my job, car breaking down, and not having childcare for some time. I would like to announce me and my baby are no longer HOMELESS! I have a car again, a stable/ permanent place to sleep, a new job in the New Year &amp; he starts preschool.
Happy for you mate ‚ô•Ô∏è
Thank you üòä
Best of luck for the future. Btw a father or mother?
It has to be a mother. There really aren't really much for shelters for men
How did you go about doing that?
Losing not loosing
Thanks I am aware, things happen..

My 8yo daughter just roasted me... and I felt proud.
You better find some way to stay ahead of her!
I have a challenge
You do. Seriously, if she gets too fresh are you able to admonish her?
Sell her into marriage
That'll chasten her!
not to discredit your daughter, but it's 100% likely she took that from YouTube
I love being a Gen X
How do i know what Gen i am?
I just really love my girlfriend
I don't have a girlfriend ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
One day man, one day
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
You're missing an arm as well.

Are you an octopus! Man they said they were smart...
As a 30-year-old dad, I wanted to prove to myself that I could go back to college and rock a full class load while working 60-hour weeks, in order to finally get a degree. Just finished my first semester back in school and qualified for the Dean‚Äôs List!
This is hardcore internalized capitalism. But congrats! I hope your path makes your life amazing

Hello my alcoholic counterpart
I've been looking everywhere for you
This whole conversation made me laugh and cry
mum called me her daughter for the first time over the phone
You are a degenerate
NAH, She's living here best life. Fuck outta here with your non-essential negativity!
Its a fetish thats gone too far and any reasonable person who points out the truth gets shat on
Congratulations.It is great to hear that you are bonding more strongly than ever. üòÄ
In my opinion, anti-boomer culture has brought Millennials and Gen Z together like no other two concurrent generations.
Hell fucking yes.
Just sayin that as a Gen Zer, I dont know any Z that would pass on avocado toast
boomer here.. introduced my gen z and millenial friends to avo toast. where do i fit in?
Even this post ignores Gen X. It's official: We are invisible to everyone.
I do absolutely nothing at work 90% of the time im working.
Maybe learn some programming? You could code some stuff and work at the same time
Ill never understand these posts. I would kill for a job like that lol.
For the first time in my life, I feel handsome
Seriously, can you leave some handsomeness in this world for us?
On a holiday in Germany, a cute looking guy was behind me in line at the supermarket and I said to my friend - after learning some of the language - 'dieser man ist niedlich!' And now I want to sink into the floor!
have taken 2 seconds longer huh
# HAVE TAKEN TWO SECONDS LONGER HUH
You're not making any sense huh!
^(have taken two seconds longer huh)
I don't speak German, but somehow the phrase sounds wrong to me...
I said that man is cute (attractive)
That back fired fast
I know!
Well how was germany anyways?
Still here and it's cold. I miss the heat of Australia.
I'm worried about hurting myself and need to talk to literally anyone
I just ate a continental breakfast at a $49 a night comfort inn, and the guy in charge of stocking the breakfast counter/keeping the tables clean took such pride in his job and was so happy, it just kinda made my whole day.
Give a good review to their manager. That goes a long way.
Kinda sucks that I doubt he makes enough to even stay one night there with how much he makes.
Do you ever write somebody or a post about a problem but while writing the message and trying to make it as understandable as you can, you suddenly understand it yourself and delete the message you spend 30mins writing?
Yep but my fucked up brain decides to send the message anyways...
Thank god WhatsApp allows you to delete messages
yeah but not if the other one already saw them...
I'll give you a tip:
Prewrite your msg in notes. 
Saved my butt more often than i would admit
I'm attracted to nice guys
Nice try, nice guy
I've never in my life met somebody that wasnt attracted to nice, kind people?
Nice guy bait
What are you getting Yourself for Christmas?
An instrument called an Otamatone
What kind of instrument is?
As a guy struggling with intimacy, I really like hugs
Everybody loves hugs!
Do you ever smell something and just become teleported through time to that specific moment and place and relive a memory or event out?
The smell is called a retreival cue!
\*looks for the twenty one pilots comment\*
Cinnamon rolls are just amazing.
They really are, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had a bad one yet
My boss just saw me working hard and said that's my girl.

I'll take things a boss shouldn't say to their employees for $500, Alex.
He's probably got a daughter her age

I asked for a very high starting salary and I GOT IT!
Congratulations mate!

My sister's cat saved our lives last night
Wow!! Gaster saved the day!!! Hope you  all gave him some treats :)
He will get plenty of treats
Aww! Yay!
Omg .. thank god for your little guy.
How'd Gaster get his name?  Quite fitting for the save!
My sister named him after a character from the video game Undertale.
Now I'm curious about the names of the other two cats
\*Gaster spares you\*
\*It fills you with determination\*
Gaster the gas detector

I'm becoming an old man
It‚Äôs not the years, it‚Äôs the mileage.
I stopped reading at oatmeal raisin cookie
To go buy some from the store?

Holy cow, that‚Äôs a lot for the UofM. Congrats! You‚Äôre talking the Twin Cities location, right?
Congratulations ! What will you be studying?
Good work. My son is a junior there. Pretty competitive institution to get accepted to!
Great job! Meanwhile I spelt boxcar wrong at a spelling bee
Thank you! Once upon a time I got out first round at a spelling bee as well
By the way, it wasn't because I'm dumb, it was because I hate stages
Successfully convinced my wife to vaccinate our son
Someone give this man a medal

I wish you well as you get adjusted to what should have always been a part of your life. üíú
HELL YES!!! I‚Äôm very close to getting out of being homeless too.
Multiple friends reached out to me when I joked that I was sad
Honestly it shows who‚Äôs the real one in your group and the fake ones.
18 friends is.. More than i have lets keep it at that
I only have 3 close friends and the rest are acquaintances
You guys have people who want to talk to you? /s but not really lmao

Did I get a job?
Congrats dude! Where are you gonna work?
Congratulations and welcome to the real world. It sucks...you are gonna love it.
i cry when imagining someone hugging and comforting me. is that weird?
Not weird at all. Sending virtual hugs
Life's too short, do whatever the fuck makes you happy
Life is short but it‚Äôs the longest thing you do.
How old are you, if I may ask?
I got a few hours to kill so ask me anything! The more questions the better, hopefully this will make time go by a bit faster
Do you like buttsex? If so, do you prefer taking it or giving?
Haha I don't mind it but it's not something important to me. And I prefer giving
Are you in schcool? Or do you work?
I work, am just about to start at a new place
What you mean by kill?
I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve been putting it off but this morning I woke up and it was hard to breathe so I got up, handed my cigarettes to my mom and put a nicotine patch on. I‚Äôm fed up man.
You can do it! It only takes three days for the nicotine to leave your system
Don‚Äôt ever forget the way that dream felt man.
Hell yeah man. Do some Pushups whenever you get a craving and you'll be yoked in no time
Step one
You can fucking do it man! I know you can! How are you feeling today?
Not bad! Today was fairly easy. Had plenty of lollipops/gum to help me.
That's good! Don't give up! :) You have any plans for the rest of the day?
I ditched all my fake friends to make real friends.
My grandfather always said, it's better to have four quarters than a hundred pennies
He may have just not liked carrying change.
Change...is INEVITABLE
Wtf is your username dude
Such a positive thread now tainted because the poster uses an actual slur for their name. :(
Lol I forgot to log off my troll account when I posted this. Oops.
This guy post so much under his ‚Äútroll account‚Äù I suspect it‚Äôs his actual personality.
Yeah I glanced at your post history and I don‚Äôt think fake friends are the issue, dude. Yikes.
Goodness me. Racist, sexist AND homophobic. I bet those friends are glad they dodged a bullet.
Who wants ANOTHER Tarot reading?
I‚Äôd like one if you‚Äôre still doing it üòå

What are you studying ? Are you hydrated and fed ?
My dad just told me he changed his faith over something I told him almost 20 years ago.
So, what did you two talk about in that life changing conversation?

My dog was found after 5 days!
Very glad that he's back, but seriously, where are the pictures?

Wasn't being really serious about it. It's just the done thing. Fire away!
Haha, I'm still more than happy to show you the pictures.
I am a straigh 22m and I have no male friends, and I think that is kinda embarrasing
There's nothing wrong with it as long as you have friends
but there is something wrong if i don't?
You're the only one being awkward about it. It's fine.
Hm, yeah maybe it is fine after all, I just wouldn't want my friends to be bored
I'm 21f and I have no friends, the only online friends I have are male. Can I meet your friends?
Guess you can also come to my birthday party :D Where are you from?

Your title is much funnier.
Omg how do I change that, it won‚Äôt let me change it???
Don‚Äôt change it. It‚Äôs hilarious. One of life‚Äôs little autocorrect gifts. üòÇ
I now fear my top reddit post is going to be about my dog seemingly sneezing into my asshole

We really need to upvote the post more. It will end up being fun for OP
Already did - someone crosspost it somewhere.
Congratulations, this post beats your 2nd highest upvoted post by about 40x
Yes it does. At least it‚Äôs a happier subject.
Nice name OP, you better be talking about OSRS though. RS3 can fuck a cactus
Ok I read the title and then the first sentence and was like this filthy bitch over here...
I‚Äôm clearly having myself a case of the Monday‚Äôs.
I'll be honest I actually first read ear until I saw the comment. Ahaha
Your what now
#DOG SNEEZES IN ASSHOLE
OP. The typo is very funny, but you can delete the post if you want.
Nooo - be interesting to see the
final total.
It would be, but OP seems embarrassed.
Your title gaffe got you 10x the clicks.
The title is bait

Didn't lock the comments because y'all can behave.
Mods saying 'yall cant / can behave' is becoming a parody. It's stupid shit, please stop.
The title says rear and the body says ear. Lol 
Sorry not funny. Kind of funny. 
Q-tip.
I got an award for the highest grade in a class in law school and I am crying

Out at a restaurant right now with my son. I can‚Äôt believe the number of people with hats on in this restaurant. When did it become socially acceptable to leave your hat on inside a restaurant when eating?
Seriously, though, what's so wrong about wearing a hat inside?

There is a difference between revealing your sexual orientation and revealing a fetish.
Soon we'll have to come out as straight...
things are changing, people aren‚Äôt scared to be themselves anymore.
if you‚Äôre a girl, you should join actuallesbians, we‚Äôd love to have you
I‚Äôm assuming you are Pan because of the emojis? Lol
yea lolol :)
How did you get food, use the restroom, etc...?
what do you mean?
I refused to give my leftovers to a homeless man, than gave it to a nicer homeless man.
Why do only people who are polite deserve to have food?
Bad behavior shouldn't be rewarded.
Bad homeless man! Bad! No dinner!
I'm sure lessons were learned that day.
I had a Star Wars marathon with my 9yo daughter and she tried to use a Jedi mind trick on me
An attempt was made.

Have you guys ever ‚Äúinvented‚Äù something before knowing that it exists?
The word ‚Äúcupcakery‚Äù and cinnamon-mint toothpaste.
I remember one time when I was in like 1st grade, I told my neighbor, who was this cool teenager that I looked up to, that I had a real, working lightsaber, and that my parents had gotten it for me for Christmas. But I said I couldn‚Äôt bring it over to show it to him.
Remind me again why indulging delusions to protect feelings is a good thing?

You can't make changes with hate. You need to work together if you want real equality.
I agree. I want to give all of you a hug.
If you're hot, holy shit imagine the boners.
Empowering women does not mean oppressing men.  Some people just don't understand that.

I'd have hi-fied you if I were present
I would‚Äôve obliged
I'd have left you hanging mid way to make the situation more awkward, tho.
I‚Äôve been working full time for 3 weeks. I have no idea how people do this forever.
Yeah but I also enjoy eating and paying for my own shit so....yeah
This shouldn't be contingent on holding a job... That's the point.

Do you ever type a whole comment just to delete it before posting it?
Lmao... I love this and hate it at the same time.
Oh dear, this is not at all going as I had hoped.
[Delyeeted]
Happens to most of us. Nowadays, I'm trying to be expressive and just post it anyways.
I always think my comments sound stupid, so yes.
I frequently write comments and then self-censor for privacy and for being afraid of rejection.
I feel that. The fear of rejection is strong. I‚Äôm glad you posted this. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
At least daily. Almost did it with this comment, in fact.
Bro I just feel like someone's probably already said it so there's no point in me saying it too
Just did it
Found an old iPod classic deep in my couch, currently have it connected to my pc and am jamming a ton of old music I can't find online anymore. Major nostalgia trip.
I found a first gen Ipad in my couch.
I found my old iPod touch but I had a password on it I can‚Äôt remember so it sucks
Damn, that sucks. Is there a way to reset the password through your AppleID account?
I thought at first you found it in your conch
What music can't you find online anymore? I bet you, you can.
Nah. A lot of it is demos of friends‚Äô bands and songs I recorded.
Can you upload the songs? All of them! I kinda wanna listen to them
deep in your couch?

Pick a fruit, any fruit...
It's as close as you can get to an apple without being an apple.

Durian?
YES
YAHHHHH WHOOT!

I'd say it has a little bit.
Significantly. I'd be shut-in but for this.
Its nice to have some kind of interactions.
Sure is. All kinds in these parts..
I had someone told me to go F myself. That hurt.
It's just a way to grow a thicker skin and more discernment. Go f yourself is mild stuff..
Ahh.. I see.. gotta start growing thicker skins. Lol.
Keep your sweetness, but know that roughness is the way of the world.

Shit, that reminds me that I need to get mine. I can NOT afford to get the flu this year.
the flu sucks
Well they were hardly going to allow it not to get it done! Autistic kids thrive on a schedule!
Troll?
This is the fakest shit I have seen in a while
Wow you hate them
Proud and unresponsible parent.
Vaccines are for the weakest links in society.
I got a job at golden corral and I left after only 3 weeks. Today was my last day. No other job has made me feel as appreciated as this one
And you're leaving all that for *best buy*??
Sorry I‚Äôm from Australia, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs American, but what is Golden Corral?
I secretly paid for a dine and dasher, but got revealed instantly
That‚Äôs freaking cool. Big up
Waiter didn't say anything to me. He just smiled knowingly when he took my check.
He‚Äôs not the hero we need, but he‚Äôs the hero we deserve.
He's actually the hero we need but do not deserve, as the guy that didn't pay shows
Not clear to me why you would do that, and anonymously at that?
Just curious....what does someone who doesnt have a wallet look like?
A t-shirt and track pants with no/small pockets
Running shorts and a t-shirt. No pockets.
Would you like a cookie?
Was the dine and dasher Michael Scott?
Agent Michael Scarn.
Damn did they call the cops on you?
For paying someone's bill? No.
It was a joke lol
You said they looked at security footage and you were busted, hence joke
I'm so sorry for missing the joke. Whoosh.
You're a good person
Salman Khan from Khan Academy should receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom within his lifetime
How in the fuck did Ellen get an award what the fuck
Wow right up till now didn't knew, Khan academy was founded by salman Khan...
Today's a pretty good day! Who wants some Gold?
Always great to be in a good mood!
Heck yeah, Tactical Man!
Thank you very much, I thought this was a joke at first. I'm in a good mood too!
Haha no jokes. Enjoy!
My favorite book us the Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman. Fantastic read
Wow. The title alone sounds interesting. I may have to look that up!
Np if I don't get anything, nice to know that you're having a great day. :)
Unfortunately I've run out of Reddit Currency. Sorry, friend! How's your day going?
Really np, had a great day. How was your day? Anything interesting Happened?
Well it's no huge news, but I got a much needed haircut today!
I made it through the week without a single thought that triggers my anxiety!!!
Give me some of that energy lol
I think more guys have to realize, that traits as a grown beard or muscular body are more important for male-male interactions, than to attract women. It will help them to be more confident with their body.
I just want to look like Gandalf when I get older
I'm a woman, and same
Mm idk, i dont care how others want my body, but i want it masculan..soo thats what im gonna do
As someone who posts, with very limited success to male nudity subs.. I beg to differ!

Anyone interested in a chat?
What kind of books do you like? Favourite book?
The Harry Potter series; classic. And I like Dan Brown too. I've read all of his books.
My favourite book is The Catcher in the Rye. I haven't read any harry potter books nor dan brown
I've heard of it. What's it about?
Basically a teenager drops out of school and decides to spend some days in NYC
Sounds nice. What else do you like?
Everyone seems to agree that Facebook is terrible. Yet they all still keep accounts. Reddit... Why do you still have a Facebook account?
At this point, mainly for the marketplace.
What you buying out there?
My son didnt choose a recognizable costume and it broke his heart. He entered a costume contest and no one clapped. He was so proud and came home feeling defeated.
Turnip head from Howl's Moving Castle?
Yes! And he was so excited about it. He said this is going to be my best costume yet.
Is he turnip from howl's moving castle?
Yes he is!
I‚Äôm sorry that happened :( I‚Äôm glad Reddit recognizes it‚Äôs though!
He looks great.
I went as the dread pirate Wesley. No one had any idea who I was.
Moving castle?
I get you little man , I went to a costume event as Bob Dylan
Who the fuck is that?  Am i too young too old or just uncultured?
Depends on your age? 
Turnip Head from Howl's Moving Castle
I originally thought the Pringles Man...
Turnip Head! I love it! He seems like a stand up kid!
My daughter's thrift store Joker costume, I think we nailed it.
Only red jacket and red pants in the store and they both fit her
This is *very* fortuitous.
Did your daughter see this movie?
Yes and loves it
Yo am i color blind cause i thought she and the joker were both wearing purple?
Different Joker. This is Joaquin Phoenix Joker.
is it just me who sees the jojo
*WRRYYYYYYYYYYYY*
She's not sure whether she wants to do the Dio or Joker pose
By her watching that movie, she is now going to go on a mass shooting spree, thanks! /s
Girl I saved from suicide texted and said she's pregnant.
Wow. Saved a life and another came from it.
Op saved 2 lives.
Not gonna lie , I didn't expect a positive outcome when I saw that title
Be honest how scared were you when a random girl texted you she was pregnant?
OP is female
Yeah but is it yours....
Probably not, since OP is a girl
One man came in another man comes out in 9 months. - Elis wife from Rick and Morty
OP does a pro-gamer move and saves an entire family tree. *You're* breathtaking!
I feel like that's worse?
Happy Halloween everyone!!
Does it smell in that pumpkin?
iPhone 4 or 4s? I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a 4s since the image is pretty nice
You win for the Sexiest costume
Son, you got a punkin on yo'head...
There goes my hero
MGG is my hero too
Today is my birthday, &amp; I gave myself a Birthday card and thought why the heck not? I‚Äôm happy. I haven‚Äôt received a birthday greeting card so here I am. What about you guys? What‚Äôs the usual things you haven‚Äôt experienced on your day? (Borrowed the format of the card from a Redditor-with permission)
Peace was never an option
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I really am.
I‚Äôm also sorry to hear that, I really am.
Happy birthday, hope you get some nice cards

I bought a pumpkin for ¬£20 and made it into a huge Cheshire Cat! He‚Äôs beautiful and I love him
This is kickass! Looks great
You gotta dress up as Alice or the Mad hatter now... or even the Queen of Hearts ‚ô•Ô∏è
Given that it‚Äòs orange it could also double as demonic Garfield
I absolutely never considered making it into a Garfield pumpkin. I feel so stupid now!!!
Give it stripes and then post it on r/imsorryjon
You have good taste in music :)
THANK YOU!!!
One of my favorite albums of all time. Early blink is soooo good
Did you post in r/halloween? Saw something like this in there earlier today. Amazing pumpkin!!
Why does this picture looks like it‚Äôs been taken in 1994?
Not gonna lie lady, you look stunning
Imagine being this lonely and pathetic on Reddit lmao
Imagine using ‚Äúlmao‚Äù on reddit
It's your happy face that makes this even better!
PHOTOSHOPPED. Enjoy your karma CHEATER :p
I'd smash.
You look like you speak British.
Very few people utilize the pumpkin anus. 
Well done, 5/5 Stars.
Listen, I know this isn‚Äôt a roast me but - it looks like you.
So cool awesome job
Autism at work
You look identical to someone who I used to know it‚Äôs crazy.
What if... I‚Äôm the person you used to know
What if...
What...... if......
I don‚Äôt think you are but if you‚Äôre not it‚Äôs scary how much you look a like
What‚Äôs the name of my mystery look a like? JUST in case!
Lucy
Well damn I‚Äôm Lucy. Who are you?!
Knew it
Or at least give me a clue!
I, a human male, received a compliment from a stranger
Hey thats awesome! Might be worth asking her out!
YES I'M ALSO A HUMAN WHO DOES HUMAN THINGS
A compliment doesn't always mean they like you, could just mean they want your money
Lol I call BS 
Congrats on the compliment sir
That's exactly what a non-human would say
Good morning reddit. What are your plans for the day?
Working, 5:15 until 13:08; maybe overtime after that.
Got chicken thawing out for dinner...
Those are some very specific times, may I ask what you do for work?
Work really. Don‚Äôt go in for 4 hours but I have trouble sleeping and it is keeping me up
It's evening here so I plan to go to bed. Had a good day though...
Have a good sleep
I bought a Lego Millenium Falcon and today I am going to assemble it. Couldn't be happier
I'm going to quit my job today.
Have you for something else lined up?
I do. It's just time for me to go.
Cheshire Cat pumpkin carving. First time shaving a pumpkin, came out pretty good :)
That looks amazing! How long did it take you?
Mm maybe an hour and a half.. the shaving took the most part
How does one best shave off the shell ?
Do you eat your pumpkins with or without the shell
Boneless...
Boneless would mean seedless, unless you keep your bones on the surface of your body
How do u get a picture on casual conversation
I was fired from my job in March. I have an incredibly promising interview tomorrow morning.
I love your attitude. Here‚Äôs to hoping you land the job!!

Hey! And let us know if you get this or not, ok? Keep us updated.
Absolutely I will.
Great! Good luck again!
What gives you that feeling overwhelming feeling of happiness and peace?
Tea in the morning also going to sleep with my electric blanket
Yooo electric blankets, that's what I'm talking about. Nothing better than being warm and cozy
Currently no power where I live and I can‚Äôt use my blanket unless I hook it up to a generator.
Oh man, where do you live?
I made this! It's the most difficult carving I've ever done
Borderlands psycho?? 
That‚Äôs pretty awesome!
Really? I thought it was a cp from Half-Life 2.
What kind of tools do you use for this? I‚Äôve always wondered how this is done
Borderlands psycho, nice! What character did you pick for BL3?
I picked Zane originally, then Amara for my second play through. I'm loving Amara
Nice! I love Amara. I went with her first and I'm thinking of starting a Zane next myself.
I saved someone's life this morning...
Things always happen for a reason!! Thank you for stopping!!
Wow I didn‚Äôt know high schoolers could drive!

I hope you will get the job!
Hey how's it going? Did you make it?
The 2010‚Äôs are ENDING?!?
Man, these transitions just feel blas√© when you remember a millennium change. 
...I feel old.
I was born 4 months before the millenium change, I remember it like any baby would
Yupp we are soon living in the twenties
time for another economic collapse
This is what I'm looking forward to!
I'm gonna buy the fuck out of that dip
Time to prepare for war! One decade away
Yeah, I know how ya feel. I could probably count all my memories from 2000's on my fingers...
If you say 10 years ago I still think you mean '98 man, it's insane how fast time flies
# woah a decade passed and i still want to die
Let's never talk about 2016.
No no no,  I'm pretty sure it's still 2012.
But remember how the 20s ended?
Yeah its crazy, im gonna miss the 2010s
I'm not. The 2010's were pretty rough for me. Lotta good personal development tho
Brown eyes are underrated
This is a fucking boost and a half thanks man
Purple eyes? lulz 
But ok I can get into brown eye appreciation, all right.
I had blue eyes for about 2 weeks when I was born but love my deep brown eyes and thank you
Everyone has blue eyes when being born, not just you, bud. Lol.
I've decided to stop smoking weed permanently.
I don't think that has to do with weed, it sounds like you were in a deep sleep.
You're cool
A girl at work called me cute
That's adorable!
Glad you felt appreciated and happy op. Have a great day :)

Hey,
Just a reminder to be nice and don't be creepy. 
Oh no...what have people been saying???

I love your user flair lol

I mean, you‚Äôre putting out there that you made the sub while also kind of being funny about it.
you should give yourself a flair
Oh! I thought that I didn‚Äôt have control over it in this sub, okay, I‚Äôll add one
Not very many people have them, but yay I gave myself one
Muahahaha
What's so funny
I copied your flair
But that's illegal
Hey, stop arguing with me. Don't you know that I made this subreddit? It says it right there.
I kinda hope my girl comes out to me now....lmao
Stepping out of my comfort zone... going to a party all alone and I'm excited AF
You are going to have an awesome time!

Congratulations! You're so strong. I hope one day I can achieve the same goal as you.
How are they so strong?  They're a junkie seeking validation on Reddit.
The Problem with Immortality
This was freaking cool to think about
The manga &gt;!Fire Punch üëä!&lt; has this as the plot and even ends the same way, prety cool üòé
How did you do that?
\&gt;!spoiler!&lt; üëç
This was fucking awesome
Nice username
I would try to research The cure of death and maybe i wont be the only inmortal here.

Holy shit, that was quite the ride
Sir, this is a Wendy's.
Can I get uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
Frosty and baked potato
Beautiful,thanks for sharing!
Eventually, Kars stopped thinking.
I scrolled down for too long trying to find the JoJo reference lol
This should be published as a book.
Just do what the ultimate life form did in JoJo shut down your mind
What would 1$ with 5% compound interest be over 1000 years?
Yep, exactly why immortality is fuckin dumb. Only an idiot would want to live forever
I work with a doctor who is wild about sweets and loves food (healthily). I think I found out why tonight and it nearly made me shed a tear.
I told a girl I could see her underwear through her leggings
Thanks for being awesome!
A good samaritan you are!!
I want to savor my Cake with all of you ... Describe the best dessert that you have ever had
Haagen dazs salted caramel ice cream bars.
Sweet heaven.
I've reached my goal weight of 112pounds !!
Congrats! how did you do it?
Just counting calories and exorcizing, the good old fashioned way :)
Good on you! Didn't realize beating ghosts/demons away was the key ;)
Oh hahahaha I am awful at spelling, but yes I must say it works up a sweat üòâ
how tall are you?
5'4 üå±
I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and my healthy range from a doctor told me it‚Äôs 125-130 
110 seems like anorexia
Best hug I've had in years.
Omg this made me tear up üò≠ So beautiful
Me too. I got to my room and let's just say I had to clean my glasses a few times.
You made someone's day. Good on you, Johnny-Holiday.
Thank you. It was a wake-up call that reminds me how much I have benefitted from kindness.
Tell Alvin I have $80 and would love a pure, heart-felt hug from him.
Alvin should become a hug whore and charge $80 per hug
I am an independent musician. I have been working on making a premiere album for a year and a half. I am disabled and don't get out and had no idea if people would like my music or not. Sixteen hours later 600 people had listened to it! =))))))
Really liked the song. Hope I can hear you on Spotify
Give me like an hour or so.
Is this available of Apple music?
It will be available on Apple Music in 3-5 business days, sorry for the inconvenience!
Feel free to sing to me for the rest of your life, thanks.
That's really awesome! Best of luck
I love the fact that you take time to thank everyone personally!
Do you play left handed or right handed guitar?
I play lefty...
Jesus Christ man this is some good shit
I love it - you have a great sound. Please keep making more music!
What great music! Reminds me of a band named Kuricoder quartet with the smoothing mellow sounds
This 100% needs to be in a Wes Anderson sound track.
Aw your music and voice are absolutely amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much for the kind words and support! &lt;3
your music is beautiful and intimate .. gets right into the heart.
Sending fatherly virtual hug your way, you deserve it! (An open letter)
Thank you for the positive vibes!
I feel slightly better, thank you!
Thank you.  I just got out of the hospital and this is the first post I saw.
You made me cry.
As my dad almost attempted to kill me once, I could definitely use that hug.
Oh my lord that's awful! Here's a hug from me too!
someone please talk to me

Does anyone else like the melancholic feel of dreary, rainy days?
Everything you just said my good sir.
Are you spying on me because it's raining where i live?
I assume you live in the Toronto area as we got our first big rainy day in a while today
My conservative Christian parents thought I was a closeted lesbian during my 20s because I rarely dated.

My country (Lebanon) is days into an ongoing revolution and reddit doesn't seem to notice at all
It won't get noticed until a celebrity says something
What do you want us to do? We can meme like crazy but thats about it.

I‚Äôm a single dad and my son (3) slept in his own bed for the whole night over the weekend. I‚Äôm feeling mixed emotions over it.

My b.  Old website. Tornadoes aren't a commom thing here I guess. It's an ef3. Is this bad?
An ef3 is one of the dangerous ones. That and above are the most dangerous type.
Oh. Fantastic!

I'm a simple man.
You cant just kick a dog and expect people to be okay with that lmao
UNLESS YOURE DIO. DANNY!
I mean, dogs aren't even allowed in the dog park.
Poor pitbull. Do that in our country and you'll get kicked too.
I have a personal downvoter and it makes me feel less alone
That‚Äôs actually hilarious
Would you feel better if I downvoted you too?
You'd be willing to do that for me?! You're too sweet
Now I don't know if I should downvote your answer too :(
Give it a whirl, just for fun
No you are too nice! I can't!
That‚Äôs honestly beautiful in its own way.

Just realized how many obese people are living in the U.S.
Where did you go in Europe? (just curious)
Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Budapest, Prague, Denmark
Surprised you skipped Croatia!
Ironically, americans don't have free healthcare.
Cause they're scrawny European.
By scrawny you mean not obese

My account was ‚Äúflagged for suspicious activity‚Äù for 3 months and now I‚Äôm upvoting anything I see.
Opinion on spaghetti
A little controversial. I love it but particularly with angel hair and just doused in hot sauce
Personally I think it's overrated
False
I only like the meatballs. What's so special about the sauce?
Sauce is very important to spaghetti
I know but I don't even like the sauce. It's just tomato what's so special about it?
There‚Äôs more than just tomato sauce. Also really complements the starchiness of the noodles.
What‚Äôs your favorite color?
Green all day fam, you?
I‚Äôm extremely happy for you and did I mention I am moist and creamy?
Tanks and planks.
Spanks and thanks
Banks and cranks
I‚Äôm going to a pub today for some yummy food and drinks :)
Tell me a joke!

Dang, I got a 78 on an easy midterm
I got 78 as well what‚Äôs coincidence
I got a 78 on two easy midterms. This is getting weird
Damn I failed out of college after getting arrested
Wanna give us a life story?
I‚Äôve noticed two types of quiet people.
I feel like you describe me in that first part.  lol.  I think you are spot on Sherlock :)
She called me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like my son‚Äù, and it hit me
To be honest, I thought this said, ‚Äúshe called me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre like my son‚Äù and hit me‚Äù. Lol
Kinky
All he needs now is to break his arms...
Wait, you‚Äôre giving me porn imagery here ...
Careful, you're summoning he who shall not be named
Too late
So you don't have any special feelings about her?
define special\~
Most sweat is bitter.

Bitter-sweet* not bitter-sweat
Hit me up.. bored as all get out
Always wondered what a triangle smells like....
Haha... smells like purple
Ooh, my favourite!  Pity you can‚Äôt taste the shapes though.
Why do you use an ellipsis in every other fuckin sentence, just use a period.
I got a 99/100 on a test!!!
Nerd.
Only joking, well done, you should be very proud.
i just made my middle school bully‚Äôs day, it felt great.
You are a great human being. Thanks for putting that kinda energy out in this world.

Hope u survive, call if u need cpr üòÇüòâ
I'd do anything to get cpr from u bby üòò

You should probably try spending less time on reddit, this is borderline paranoid ideation.
Attempting to throw others off your scent, I see.
How the heck do you respond to ‚ÄòHows it going?‚Äô
‚ÄúLiving the dream, my friend‚Äù is my favorite response.

Visit Japan and try sushi! I've never had authentic sushi before. :)

visit Iceland, Norway, and Newfoundland
KFC vs Burger King vs McDonald's
McDonald's chicken nuggets all the way with a chocolate shake and BBQ Sauce. Omg it's so good
Will definitely try it out next time I'm there. No chocolate shake in McDonald's India though:(
Oh dang that really sucks. I didn't even know that India had McDonald's there

That's what I call rising to the challenge

I'm not great at numbers so maybe that's why I find it weird 
I can say I love you, go faster all hail the f√ºher and hail Germany 
I was too lazy to do the dishes so I bribed my friend with a can of Pringles to come over and do them for me. She woke up from her nap and 5 minutes later was at my doorstep wheezing WHERE ARE MY PRINGLES
Nobody ever pays me in Pringles
people usuallu just pay me with gross money. 
Ew, money
The upside is you can trade your money for more pringles
Explain how...
Money can be exchanged for goods and services
I'd do a lot of things for a can of sour cream and onion Pringles. She's a smart one. 
You think I could pay hookers in Pringles?
How did they get _IN_ the Pringles to begin with, though?
I wish I had friends like that (or any friends...).
Perhaps it's your username....
i would do anything for a can of pringles 
*anything?*
**anything**
*what if i personally asked you to get me pringles?* 
I thought gum was the only currency that was food. 
I'll vacuum if you have any more Pringles
I did the vacuuming already, but you could wash my dishes the next time they're dirty.  
I have done far more for far less.  
I like to drive, I'll pass on driverless cars.
Likewise. 
And plus it's a little uneasy knowing you won't have full control of the car either. 
You want have a choice if they make it mandatory eventually

I had my Fallopian tubes removed a year ago. I didn't keep them, that would have been gross.
&gt;.&gt;
I'd have kept them.
Why don't people use their blinkers?
People are lazy. 
Laziness?  I guess?
It could really grind your gears if you had to suddenly shift as a result.
My wife just asked if the strong winds we currently experience stem from the Hurricane... we live in southern germany.

Keep thinking that then. 
Plenty of non American don't know their geography. 
Sounds like she probably has two big globes already.
Big german ones. 
Well... butterfly flaps its wings and all that.

Not sure if it's an exotic animal and I'm not sure if its my favorite, but the Kiwi is cuuuuute.

What constitutes exotic? I like penguins, but dunno how exotic they are. 
Lol, pretty much any creature that isn't native to your country and/or continent. 
Is a Quokka exotic? I mean for an American it is but in the long run?
As long as it isn't native to your country, then it's exotic. Even invasive species count. 
I'm a project manager in a software development department.
I know very little about software but it's always seemed so interesting... And stressful...

So what changed between high school and now? 
Girls didn't like me
I like you
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers
Time to make some babies! Haha, good luck dude! 
Or maybe friendship and human connection, rather than selfishness and the isolation that follows
I was obviously joking -_-
The first girl I ever asked out I got married to.
Fun fact, I've never successfully asked a woman out.
Am married with a child.
#life

First class of BJJ, been interested for a while and finally decided to
What's BJJ? 
i went on a date with a dream guy today! Jesus. he is so perfect! but i was so awkward, i acted like a literal potato! how was your day?
Another senseless day, being 19 yo ugly guy sucks as always.
Don't worry. He's probably thinking the same thing.
Ask me any questions and I will answer them!
What do you think look better on men, boxers or briefs?
Not the OP but I had to chime in...boxer briefs are my favourite on dudes.
I didn't even think about boxer briefs, but I have never owned any, how comfortable are they?

Truth...
Why did you start using Reddit?
My ex made me one
I became hooked 
We broke up
I made a new one 
Here we are. 
Sorry to hear about that. At least your love of Reddit remained 
Mainly because I wanted to participate in some of the sub related to what I like.
Met good friend's girlfriend, she didn't like me. He told me she said it's me or her.
How long has he known her?
A year, he started dating her a month ago. 
Wow. Kinda a dick move on his part.
Obviously most of the blame goes to succubus girl wonder.
I agree. Maybe our paths will cross again in the future. 
Try to be there for him when she inevitably fucks him over, too.
You're right, I can see that happening. Which will suck, because he isn't a bad dude. 
Sorry to hear that chap.
What would 13 year old you be most proud of current you of?
Probably how ive managed to learn to face some of my fears.
What were some fears?
Ask me a question, then I¬¥ll respond and ask you a question!
Are you a dog person or a cat person
What are your go to pizza toppings?
What is your dream car?
I'm too lazy to go to the gym today. What do I do to overcome this?
Favourite biscuit variant? Mine are shortbread.
I have an in person job interview today for a career opportunity in my field. After months of phone rejections, job applications, a messed up laptop, eating ramen, I finally get to see someone face to face for an interview.
GOOD LUCK! ITS NOT YOUR LAST SHOT, LOVE. 
AHHHHH!
I know, but I always get my hopes up for no reason. 
Never forget it's not your last shot! Be persistent! Have confidence!
Grab‚Äôem by the pussy!!
Good luck. Hope you crack it. 
Goodluck man!
What do you look like in your dreams?
I don't think that I have ever seen myself in a dream. I wonder what that means 
I see myself with bangs and dark hair...sometimes I don't have a body. 
And what's your hair like in real life?
Long and brown, no bangs
Why are you up late?
It 11am over here, I'm about to head over to campus.
Heartbroken. 
What are your 2018 travel plans?
Poland. I want to see my ex lol

You just made this weird. But thanks
Love is weird?

Are you trying to sell me chocolate or what?
Did someone say *chocolates*
I remember when they first invented chocolate. *Sweet, sweet chocolate* 
I always hated it!
WHATRE THEY SELLING??
THEYRE SELLING CHUAHKLATES
I thought you would never say it! It's been 24 years!
I was busy, god
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS TOO BUSY TO LOVE ME
Prove it!!!
Get to know me, I bet you'll fall out of love for some reason :)
Why would I get to know someone I already know everything about? 
It's not like I like YOU, or a-anything
B-baka!
why
Aww! This is like him to me....
At least buy me dinner first
I don't know you anymore. 
It was a **mistake**
Was it **really**?
HE KISSED ME WHEN I WASNT EVEN LOOKING
How were you not looking out the front of your face?
He was wearing all camouflage 
Camouflage doesn't make people invisible when they're that close. 
Aww thanks, lol. Love you too.
It's not you, it's me.
I am going to make assumptions about you based off your usernames.
Hit me with what you got!
Do mine thx
You like to takes things slowly. You enjoy your me time and rather not have to socialize a lot. 
Dang, I was late.
-leaves pie for you- 
It's a shame this is closed. I'd be low hanging fruit.
This will be fun
And well you should!!
You try to keep things simple because if not you get overwhelmed. 
Seems interesting enough, why not 
I'm very interested in what you have to say
What are your guilty pleasure songs?
Abba.

A homeless woman teaches me a lesson.

Choose one - Would you rather??
Could I choose the first one but still eat and keep my perfect body?
Good question..haha, I just modified the question to account for this.
Yeah, in that case the answer is I'd take neither. 
That's not how it works lol
I want to change and become a better version of myself that I can fine with. 
Do you know how you would like to be?  
No :(
It is hard to make general changes.   Can you think of something concrete to change?
It's hard when life doesn't go as planned. 
In the middle of writing my personal statement OMG it's really hard
If anybody is still active in this thread, please celebrate my 100 days on reddit with me :)
What small thing do you love?
When someone tells a joke that makes me legitimately laugh, not just a polite/ mandatory laugh 
It's pretty hard to find someone who can do that. 
I just witnessed a girl at the gym turn on the treadmill to the highest setting. She had both feet on the side of the machine while she was on her phone. She did that for about 30-40 minutes without ever running. Then, she left. It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen, what's your take on it?
App connected to the treadmill, posting huge results to a profile while doing nothing.
Some people are so hooked on social media it's become reality for them.
Just look at reddit.  People think this shit is real life.
Maybe she was training her phone?
Maybe she fully intended to run, but got trapped in the one more click cycle.
Quite possible. But, why did she have the treadmill running? 
I'm just surprised how she was able to stay in that position for so long.
A lot of practice.
Standing Therapy. üëç
She can do it on her back, too.
???
(I was making a joke about her having open legs)
She‚Äôs probably going there just to say that she goes to a gym.
She was recording her heartbeat for this other girl who wants to be an astronaut.
Bruh you reached all, congrats
Thinking about moving in the next two years. Can you tell me why your state or country is a great place to live ?
Do not move to Texas. 
Iowa has little crime other than idiots doing their thing.
about to pull an all nighter, any tips on how to pull through even if i feel like death?
Coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. 
I'm about to ask out a guy I like later today, and I have a lot of nervous energy!
I have no good advice to give but I wish you luck :) keep us informed, you can do it ! 
Thanks so much, I really hope it goes well haha, I'll let you know how it goes :)
Go for it! Tell us how it went :)

Not being loved.
Where would you like to travel to? 
I like the sound of typing on a keyboard
I type with one finger.

Yeah it takes me forever to type. 
I like the iphone keyboard pop noises a bit. 
My bf just got a mechanical keyboard and I love the clicky noise
ohhh aren't those the keyboards that have the really thick keys like an old iMac keyboard?
Get a cherry bridge mechanical keyboard, Once you go clack you don't go back.
I want one so bad! But I have a laptop and no place for a desktop :(
Get a lap desk, might give you enough room for a keyboard.
Yeah... but even then I don't have a place for an actual computer. My room is heckin' small 
What is the meaning of life to you?
I've heard that before but what does that actually mean?
It is the answer, but what is the question?
So the meaning of life is 21x2.
That can't be the right one. 
Is it 43-1?
Can't be it either.
If the answer is 42, then what is the question - you seem to know...
To take a shit, and maybe fuck a few hoes 
Whoa there, buddy, don't get too ambitious!
I am a pawn. My purpose is to survive. 
Do you get a say in  life as a pawn?
Do you feel conscripted? 
No, not based on what I googled. 
Glad you feel that way, Pawn. 
-_-
Ever see GoT where Theon Greyjoy *actually became* Reek?
I've never seen that show.

You could meet someone while doing food?

I haven't had those in like a decade. How would you describe the taste? 
Pretty much how they've always been, like highly concentrated sugar. So if you like sugar...
We can agree to disagree on this.
I honestly don‚Äôt like candy corn but i bought it anyway. I really enjoy the texture 
Yeah, it's hard to describe but I like it too. Almost a sort of waxy feel.
Try it with peanuts.
Don't really like peanuts, unfortunately.
What's candy corn. I'm Scottish so I've never had one
They're basically candy forms of concentrated sugar. They seem to only be popular in the US.
What flavour are they?
Can you remind me of any song in 3 well formated words or less?
Hello it‚Äôs me

I knew it! Exept I really didn't. I'm going to give it a listen :)
Btw I'm probably gonna comment a ton cause I love this idea lol
This is gonna be a train wreck because I don't listen to that much rap
Sex, money, murder

Still hanging out with friends in high school?
Yup, I'm seeing two of them next week, and we graduated over 15 years ago.  
Oooh, nice! Have fun!
No, I don't see any of high school classmates anymore.
Just got rejected, try and cheer me up Reddit.
By even trying, you have more courage than most people including me
History is really interesting but school just made it boring.
GRRM partially based Game of Thrones on the war of the roses I believe too. 
Yep GoT is basically the war of the roses with dragons lol. 
Working overnight
What kind of overnight shift?
Front desk at a hotel! Currently running the nightly audit. 
any exciting guests coming through the doors?
Where do you live? 
Anybody up? I'm drunk and lonely.
I'm stoned? Does that count?
Close enough, I'll take it. What's on your mind?
I‚Äôm up and sober sadly. 
 Unless there‚Äôs wine I forgot about. 
Find that wine. I believe in you. 
Damn, was gone for an hour haha
What are you allergic to reddit?
Easy to avoid, but I do miss eating them. 
Honestly just want someone to talk to.
hi man 
Hi. 
hey 
how is your day?
I'll look into for sure!
Hey how's it going
It's going alright. How about you?
Good as it can get while in math class
I feel you on that. High school or college?
Luckily High school but still boring 
Ask me the toughest question you can think of...
How tough are ya?
How tough am I?
 I ate a bowl of nails for breakfast.
That‚Äôs not very tough...
How do you make EVERYONE happy?
You smile and tell jokes. For example, what do you call two doctors?
A pair-amedics.
You couldn't possibly tell jokes to everyone.
Do you wanna be friends?
Hii, the name is Bee.
Wanna talk about our Lord beet farmer, dwight shrute?
I have no idea what that is, but sure come with it!
Name is Brian. Nice to meet you. Gotta go back to work but if you respond I will.
I tend to assume every user on Reddit is a male until they mention otherwise.
My name has girl in it and yet I am referred to as a male until I point it out
Mine has a woman's name, but people do assume I'm male.  Actually, I kind of like it.
Don't worry man. Happens to the best of us. 
We men have to stick together after all. 
You got Moxie kiddo
Sorry, what? I'm here now. 
I remember when I had moxie
To be fair, my username has ‚Äúwoman‚Äù in it and I‚Äôm a dude
Equally as confusing, my username references several men and I'm a woman
And I'm a straight guy from Nebraska.
Wait, are you all saying that our usernames don't have to be something true about ourselves? 
Only French speakers can guess (?) that I'm female. Most of the time, I'm a dude or whatever.
Hello there my man how do you do
There always has to be one smart ass in the group doesn't there
üëçüëç
M‚Äôlady
r/niceguy ?
Nah just ironically
  I own a Fedora I thought maybe we had something in common
Oh idk fedoras are pretty ironic if you do it right but I‚Äôm not a nice guy lol
I was really into Indiana Jones when I got mine
Lol that seems about right
People assume I'm a dude all the time because of my user name. 
how many booties have you gotten so far?
Sup dude, how's the dick having life? 
Two others already beat you to the punch and try again sweetheart
who the hell reads usernames? 
Your daddy 0-0-7 that's why he is at the top of his game
ü§îü§îü§î
are you male then?
relax, dude.
So far you are the 4th person to make this joke I wish somebody would be original ;)
I never look at usernames unless it's brought up by another user. 
good rule but you miss out on cool names 
I'm not sure about others but I don't usually read usernames.
odd man out 
So it would seem...
I feel like you have many layers but maybe you don't want to share them
They say us onions are like ogres, we have layers.
And if you have an odd number there's an odd one out or it's just a twister game
Do onions make you cry?
okay dude, I'll try not to do that.
Mine has Chick in it. NO one bothers to see that part. 
Yeah what is 1731 sat January 7th 1931? (Don't make me go to Wikipedia)
How you doing my man?
Unarmed please spare me
The King in the North takes no prisoners.
Isn't the King of the North really a Queen currently?
I don‚Äôt know haven‚Äôt watched Season 7 yet :D
I did but I didn't pay much attention
Still how are you fellow human?
Literally only a woman can queef, yet still baseline assumption is I‚Äôm a guy. 
I'm not going to go into details but look up sounding
hi o/
I assume everyone on Reddit is a 20-something Caucasian male in the US.
Well, on average, they are. 
I literally posted my NUDES on Reddit and still get referred to as a guy. There‚Äôs no winning 
Everyone on the internet has a penis. Everyone. They mail one to you if you don't have one.
Well the first rule of the internet is there are no girls on the internet so :/
I thought that was rule #33
Female here... And also not a nerd *gasp*
Kill it with fire!? /s
**DMs**
Idk what that means
Unless I can see nudes on the profile, I'll assume male.
I like that my username is non-gendered. No one knows who I am! 
You are a despicable Jew?
Teach me how to be yada yada yada master.
You mean reply to basically everything with what seems to be a well thought out answer?
This reply wasn't a well thought out answer
Movie night alone! What's everyone up to?
Also planning to watch a movie! I'm watching Frances Ha
Haven't heard of it. What's it about? 
I have been wanting to watch a good movie but can never find anything actually good
I just got hired for my first job
That's good you must have done many things right, many people do not get hired.

Not enough it seems, maybe I ought to have one now.
Zero.  Yes, I am smug about it.
How do y'all survive without a single sip of coffee? Like seriously? xD
I don't drink coffee, I prefer tea over coffee. 
Share some love for the tea-loving fanatics!

What is something that is normal in your country but other people don't understand?
Eating way steak (tartare) with a raw egg and a lot of spices.
What is way steak?
I'm not sur but I think he wanted to say raw, not way
Isn't it dangerous to eat it *raw raw*?
Not if the hygiene rules(?) are correctly followed, and if the egg is fresh.

Im not smiling because it‚Äôs 3 in morning and I can‚Äôt sleep
Why can‚Äôt you sleep?
Im at work bored.
Just smiling to pass the time or does work require you to smile?
Because my wife is curled up beside me and she looks adorable when she's asleep
Poke her nose. If she asks why say, ‚ÄúBecause Reddit.‚Äù
I'm not, but usually when I smile it's because of the people I love
Smile at one of them and say, ‚ÄúBecause I love you.‚Äù
And just leave it at that.
private jokes
Like inside jokes?
Because im tired of life. Im not smiling obviously 
Take a break.
That's not an option, I'm far enough behind as it is.
I'm about to leave lunch and go back to work. Not smiling...
Did you enjoy your lunch?

I always just order from Domino's and do the deal for a medium 2 topping pizza.

TIL this emoji ü§ó means a hug, not a person politely declining something
üò§ I can‚Äôt tell if this is a crackhead or someone sighing profusely 
It's a humph. 
Shit, I thought it was jazz hands 
üé∫‚ò†
Same. I thought it was basically an emoji doing this...üôåüèª  
How can you say same, but then say something that‚Äôs not same.
I don't have the fonts installed, so they're all just empty boxes to me.   \¬Ø\\\_\(\„ÉÑ\)\_\/\¬Ø
üôèis a side view of a high-five and not a praying emoji.
Wait what? Then what's the praying emoji?
üôÑ
I thought this was the blow job emoji
Til it isn‚Äôt smiley face with jazz hands ü§ó 
Free hugs ü§ó
Hug with 3 pats on the back

Enjoying my 3 days off. 
I just listened to an album right through for the first time ever
Laturalus by Tool is my favorite album to listen to over and over 
When Your Heart Stops Beating by +44. It's pure perfection imo, I never skip any tracks on it.
Sounds good, what genre are they? I'll check 'em out 
Pop-punk/alternative rock!
Is This It by The Strokes is a perfect album in my opinion. Definitely check that out. 
Edge of Twilight by the tea party :)
Churrrr
Demon days by the Gorillaz or Blue Album by Weezer.
Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie and Infinite Sadness. It is a long one but worth it!
How about albums with a single song that is 1+ hour? 
I've always liked Hot Fuss by The Killers or Zaba by Glass Animals!
Clutch's Elephant Riders is a solid choice, OP.

Just bought a load of stuff for this reason.

Ha! Just wait until you get to 35, you grouchy old bugger.
I can‚Äôt wait -_-
I just realized that ftfy meant ‚Äúfixed that for you‚Äù and not ‚Äúfuck that fuck you‚Äù
TIL what ftfy means.
I remember a post which had somebody who thought TIL meant true in life. 
And then everyone started posting the same kind of post for massive amounts of karma?
I just figured out FWIW and IIRC. It's been a day.
What the fuck do those mean 
For what it's worth, if I remember correctly.
Holllyyyyyyy shittttt my entire life is a lie 
Actually, that's kinda true. For instance, colors aren't real! Your brain makes them up.
No don‚Äôt pls 
You can thank Bio Psych for that.
Your brain basically hallucinates your complete reality. Bawooosh, mind blown.
Also IANAL stands for I am not a lawyer, and not whatever you were thinking üòâ
I thought it meant I ANAL
Which generation are you from? 
I guess generation x I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called
Yeah, but what does IIRC mean?
If I remember correctly, for what it‚Äôs worth
For some reason I though it was If I recall, because that's how my brain works.
That‚Äôs cause that‚Äôs what it is.
Have you tried counting the words and letters?
I meant ‚Äúif I recall correctly‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúif I remember correctly‚Äù.  L2infer. 
Sir, please adopt me.
I mean, I'm a lady, but sure!
I thought it was ‚Äúif I recall‚Äù
Saaaaaaaaaame differeeeeeennnnnncccccceeeee.
The weirdest one to me is IANAL. 
what does it mean???
I Am Not A Lawyer. How often does that come up that you need an acronym for it?
I thought FWIW was For Whoever Is Wondering... I‚Äôm an idiot. 
IMNSHO those acronyms are overrated, but YMMV.
What's ymmv?
Your Milage May Vary.
Wait until you discover this subreddit! /r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG
Me, looking at the link: Do I dare disturb the universe?
Go for it. It's not nsfw.
I'm afraid.
IIRC: If I rape children
What do you mean, if?
I think I like your version better.
I like mine too
I thought it meant 'Fuck this, fuck you' until today. Close enough I guess. 
I still don't know what smh means
Shaking my head 
Wait, so what does FFS mean, then?
For fucks sake
Tell me you know what IANAL means...
Initiate ANAL?
ITT: people learning internet abbreviations.
ITT: people discover they are as much an idiot as OP (me)

UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG

Crunchy or creamy?
I prefer creamy, but my wife likes crunchy. I'm fine with either.
I thought I was fine with either, until today. I don't understand how this happened to me.
Let us take a moment to mourn the passing of preference for crunchy peanut butter.
Should we all have peanut butter stuck to the roof of our mouths for this?
Absolutely. And at the wake we'll have various peanut butter snacks.
Crunchy. I like to know where my various butters come from.
Where's the just regular peanuts option?
Regular peanuts roll out of the sandwich.
well your first mistake was peanuts and sandwiches
Crunchy. So crunchy is like I'm putting sucky peanuts on my honey toast
sucky peanuts? does not compute

Question for white guys, name a black female celebrity (or famous instagram model) that you find attractive?

Both of those girls are gorgeous! I find it amazing how they are both aging so well. 
Meghan Merkel. So cute. 
Have any of you revisited old, irrelevant games from your past that you love?
Has anybody played Red Alert 2? I redownloaded it a few weeks ago. Those were good times.

Tjena, hur √§r l√§get?
There should be a subreddit for pairing people up to do nothing except check in on each other once or twice a week to ask how their day has been.
Sounds like it ought to be named /r/casualfriends
What about /r/penpalsofreddit
Says it is unavailable/private
I fuckinhate Christmas
What are you doing right this second?
11:30 in FL. Just started watching die hard. 
Good idea! Maybe I‚Äôll queue it up now so I can watch it with you 
Can‚Äôt go wrong with a classic 
Lying in bed
Sounds warm and cozy 
More just wishing the blanckets were thicker
I‚Äôm guessing you live somewhere cold 
Nah, just near an ac vent
Turn that shiz off then! :)
Watching Supernatural season 10 and browsing reddit :)
Nice! I‚Äôve never seen that show. I‚Äôm guessing it should check it out 
I suggest it. But there's loads of feels in some of the episodes.
I like da feels 
Playing XCOM 2, drinking tea, listening to youtube videos. All in all, nice night! 
I'm having a shitty Christmas and I want just want to wish a merry christmas to everyone who's going through the same!
I am just in my room reading reddit memes.
I'd take the screaming kids any moment :(
What games are you guys playing?
Skyrim, the fact that you can do so much with the game is what makes it cool.
Mods add practically infinite replay value too! I love messing with the physics
The Telltale series? I screwed that up badly the first time D:
One thing I'm afraid of is when we colonize Mars, there will be Earth Truthers claiming that humans never came from Earth and that Earth never existed.
This is so plausible it's actually kinda sad.
There will always be idiots, don't plan your future around them. 
Have you ever read Asimov's Foundation series?
I wouldn't worry so much about things that are 10000 years in the future.
What if we were from Mars and came to Earth
It will start as a joke and satire. It will get adopted by morons.
Except you can literally see Earth from Mars. Just saying.
Does anyone else feel it's hard to make irl friends?
I can make friends but close friends now that's hard to find.
True distinction. 
So I logged into this account
I‚Äôm surprised someone hasn‚Äôt messed it up already.
Nope, still works.
I'll log out and leave it as found.
Fair enough. I hope it stays like that for a while, it‚Äôs a nice idea.
Dick is short for Dicholas 
Different user again. It would be awesome if it remained like this.

Does anyone hate when you see a thread that you have a good comment for, but the thread was made 5+ hours ago and your comment feels useless?
Ask me in 5hrs ...
The only solution is vigilance, subreddit surveillance, cocaine and multiple screens. 
Once posted in a thread over a year old. OP still responded
I thought the posts automatically get archived after 6 months? 
might have exaggerated a bit
Yes, all the time...hope I'm not too late for this one!
Here's an orange envelope for you friend! Hope your day's going well. 
Thanks, friend! So far, so good (despite the usual anxiety). Hope your day is going well too!
Yeah not bad! just another hour and a half of my work day to go! Huzzah!
Yes right on! Now probably less than an hour left...wait same here for me!

Hey /u/MetalJaw, how has your day been? :) 
Not so good, but it has gotten better.
What's going on that's made your day not so good?

How do you want to die. 
Truth and Dare nsfw ok
Are you still playing this? I'm fine with truth or dare. 
Yeah. Do you want one or the other or both?
Alright, let's play it. Can go NSFW if you want.
Am pretty sure I'm late to this possible truth or dare :(
It just dawned on me I've never seen a Corgi in person
I rarely see them but when I do it's almost always when I am running and I can't pet them
... This just blew my mind. I haven't seen either ,but I love corgis.
The Corgi is a mythological creature. Like owls.
And Finns
All Finns or just the Sami?
What if the real Corgis are the friends we've made along the way?
They are real, and they're even more cute and dinky than you'd expect them to be.
Why must you torture me so üò¶üò¢üò≠
If you live in California, go to Corgi Beach Day in Huntington Beach it will change your life.
Live with a corgi, can confirm their existence
WE HAVE A CORGI AND LOVE IT! 
I love your corgi too &lt;3
Where do you live that you‚Äôve never seen a corgi and have only recently seen a dachshund? 
You've never seen me either.
Am I a ghost?
I mean, maybe? For all I know you are a super smart cat
I'm far too dumb to be a super smart cat.
No saying you're dumb, Lucas!
23F looking for conversation..
Tell me your job please
Why don't I hear people talking about being VEGETARIAN, why do people always want you to immediately turn vegan?
Labels are stupid.
Im Brazillian, so i gotta ask: why go vegan?
Are you being sarcastic? I genuinely can't tell. 
No, vegetarians and vegans arent a fad in here as much as in the states
My BF told me stories until I fell asleep last night.
Have you even heard the tragedy of Aesir Loki the wise?
It's not a story the Norse are likely to tell...
My schoolteacher named her child something very unfortunate
While unfortunate, people need to be kinder anyways.
Children are always kinder!
My mom just called me a failure to my face. Could use some cheering up. :/
self esteem 
I am an agnostic atheist and I hate it when atheists ridicule religious people
Agnostic atheist is a major oxymoron.
5 q's going up... on a tuesday.
1. Not for a while.
2. Naughty.
3. No good reason why not.
4. A maths professor. 
5. Miss
a maths professor! what the.
What the what? Did I misunderstand the question somehow?
nah just saying, it's not common for ppl to want to become maths professors
Do you ever answer these questions :P
I‚Äôm lonely as hell
You can talk to me.
I know how you feel completely. Hi. 
Anyone here feel they've wasted huge chunks of their life?
Kind of?  School was mostly a waste of time and money.
I agree, feel my associates did nothing -.-
I have a bachelors and I have never felt more worthless in my life 
whats it in?
What will you keep doing for the rest if your life?
Lay down, try not to cry, cry a lot.
Sometimes it's important to cry. It's okay.
Sorry to be so whiny, i don't think it was the type of comment you where expecting
22 year old female
I'm a 22 year old male who's also lonely. Let's be friends.
Alright. Hi. 
How's it going? What'd you get up to today?
It's going good. Nothing much just relaxed at home today. 
How did you meet the person you're currently dating?
Tinder obviously.
Lol so mater of factly hahaha
I was surprised no one mentioned it before me :P
Still well played lol
I finally deleted the Facebook app from my phone
I like FB so.... Bring on the downvotes and redditors telling me it's the devil.
I deleted my Facebook 7 years ago and never looked back
Does anyone want to play the question game?
Most overrated TV show?
Full house - sucked then, no justification for fuller house now. 
Hi, relationship-wise, right now I'm single and looking for a GF.
How hard are you looking?
Moderately hard, but not very smart.
Why do you ask? Do you know any potential girlfriends?
Being single kinda sucks
Just got informed I will be getting divorced at 36 so yeah I feel ya on that one.
Ah shit man... I‚Äôm sorry. My mom is twice divorced so I‚Äôm 100% understanding the pain.
I love it when I‚Äôm watching a show or movie and it takes place somewhere I‚Äôve lived or been and I can recognize landmarks and things
This has never ever happened to me lol 
Let's take stabs at each other.
Youre a fucking idiot and your parents never loved you.
Stab me bruh
Anyone else think it‚Äôs basically impossible to have a differing opinion on reddit?
*Umm... I disagree*

*turns into group hug*
Wow man, I'm also 20 and this gives me hope. 
Keep believing!

My boyfriend was 27 when he got his first! Sometimes it takes time especially if you‚Äôre shy!
What did you feel during the kiss?
Probably lips.
Still waiting for mine and Im 22..

Fuck is that supposed to mean? 
Syntax error?
Winking face with puckered lips?
Could be anything I guess!

 Awesome!! What did you do on the first date?
I had an awesome date last night!
Sounds awesome! This made me happy to read.
How nice! Got any advice for me. I haven't got a date :(
Just tried a Reese's for my first time
That's probably like among my favorite chocolates there are. That sugar. :d
I love the Reeses peanut butter bites.
Are those mini versions of the cups or the M&amp;M looking ones?
The M&amp;M looking ones.
 wasabi and soy sauce almonds. I made myself sick the other day by eating way too much. 
Oh damn. I LOVE spicy foods and anything that makes me sweat. 
Get the blue diamond brand it's way good. 
Did you try this brand for your first time?
 No the first timer I had them they were from Sprouts Market. 
You threw them out?? You monster!
I never realized that this would be the biggest regret of my life so far :(
Your post prompted me to add this to my shopping list for my next trip
I'm also new to to Reese's I was presently surprised with the little cupcakes.
so what'd you buy today?
Not a damn thing. Still trying to recover from my massive hangover 
too much wine? lol
Nothing I wanted was on sale, so I didn't buy anything :(
What did you want??
I kind of wanted a bigger ssd for my laptop
They had those on sale on amazon!
I live in Canada so it's not as big here :(
I need someone to hug me and tell me it‚Äôs going to be okay. what trying days I‚Äôm so exhausted

Almost 3000 now
Reddit may be a fickle beast, but it came through for OP today
And over 3000. Next stop: 4K
I just hit 10k a little while ago lol 
Check mine. Sorry.
How to get karma (what is it)
I like how your comment sounds like a google search!
Im a noob , i came from the far lands of buzzfeed
Go back.
Why the hatred dude .
I'm waiting for my 100k karma
Where can one see one's karma? 
When you get 255,000 like I have, you realize you‚Äôve wasted your life. 
Yeah when I hit 100,000 I thought something really cool was gonna happen... it did not.
Wait til you hit a million, then you get the key to the blackjack and hooker room
I know what you mean.  I'm sitting at 999 right now.
Enjoy the pasta :)
BOOM, You‚Äôre welcome!~
I‚Äôm currently at 990

I just reached 10k the other day!
I'm almost 500! Where's the party tonight? 
I‚Äôll give the first like to start the party
Getting karma is easy. Having people remember you is difficult
Keep going. You can do it! 
We'll see you in Century Club when you've reached 100,000. 
&lt;3 
I think I'm wasting too much time here...

I got my dream job offer!
So yeah. My day was ok :)
I destroyed my squat PR
What's everyone up to before Thanksgiving?
Working.
Wokring tomorrow?
I'm playing overwatch:)
My cousin plays that, but I can't get into it. 
Are ring pops the worst candy in the world? Because I'm at work with one in my mouth and it sure feels like it.
I appreciated the imagery. 
Bet she had left over Halloween candy she wanted to get rid of. 
No, circus peanuts are the worst candy in the world.
They're not so bad.  At least they're not messy and sticky.
&gt;not ... sticky
Drop even a half a drop of liquid on them and yes they are. 
Well they make up for it with that fabulous flavor they have!
Candy corn is up there too but I think you‚Äôre right 
Can't have Butterfinger without candy corn, I love it.
How so?
Butterfinger is candy corn mixed with peanut butter.
Necco Wafers would like to have a word.
I love circus peanuts 
Candy corn is Satan. 
Why? They're like condensed frosting.
I like ring pops 
You must have not tried orange jelly candy. Those things are straight from hell awful. 
Have you tried the chocolate covered ones? Heaven.
They have rasberry ones too! Omnom!
What is the favorite thing about the country you live in?
Northern Ireland - The Ulster fry. 
Wow northern Ireland! The Ulster fry is a breakfast right (according to Google).
My simple mind: I feel better having stopped paying for cable, so perhaps I'll stop paying for internet too and actually go outside/do something productive, most likely feeling better.
It's incredibly naive to think you can get anywhere in life these days without the Internet 
It's not even thanksgiving yet and I'm sick of Christmas
I agree, but I worked retail in my past life, so I hate Christmas with the heat of 1,000 suns.

Do you ever feel bad about your body but are too lazy to do anything about it?
Yeah I was like that for years and then I just got fed up with it. Turned everything around. 
That's so great! What made you take the leap?
You just gotta do it, and keep doing it. Motivation doesn't last forever, but discipline can.
Mostly in the flexibility point. I'm fine with my body shape.

Better than being called ma'am by a police officer.
I was 15.
I am also a dude.
Why does this make you feel bad? That's cute
I'm 43 and still feel weird when someone calls me sir.

What would you do if you'd be diagnosed with wheat intolerance in x years?
No additional flavoring????
Sure but that's just bonus points

Small but noticeable.
Why are you so worried about it then?
Hmmm. I too never heard of one of the biggest phobias.
One of the biggest phobias, but not over a little ass spider. People need to grow up.

IÔ∏è have a freckle on my left middle finger.
I have one on my right ring finger
Did it help you learn left from right growing up? Because mine helped me do that.
I don‚Äôt think so, in fact I may have only just noticed it.

I can tell who is around me by the way they walk. 
I know how to classify clouds.
I noticed the guy next to me on the plane watching my movie, so I turned on the subtitles
Heyy.. that was very considerate of you. You're a wonderful person, you know?

You're a great person! I hope you're married or else I'm gonna ask you out!
Aha, not married, but very much in love with my SO. :)
I Whistle-blew on my manager, who then proceeded to e-term me. Millions of mismanaged funds will finally be going back to the hospital patients
That sounds really sketchy.
What does E-term mean? 
I Miss Barack Obama.
obama should make a comeback by being the coolest and the most clever comedian ever.
I miss having an adult in the white house too

What are you in school for if it's not high school. 
Does it blow anybody else's mind that Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr. were born about six months apart?
The Aztec Empire, Roman Empire, and Ming Dynasty all existed at the same time. 
Wow, I always thought that the Aztecs were like... way back.
As a child, I often thought I fooled people with my clever bullshitting. As an adult who can easily see when a child is bullshitting, I now realize my child self likely fooled 0 people.
Sorry for my ignorance but English isn't my first language. What is bullshitting?
How would you like your life to be 1 year from now?

Welcome to adult life, it gets scary some times.
Take good care of the children. 
They are the future. 
What country
US
What state!
IÔ∏è (a recently turned 18 year old) have never been allowed to close my door at home.
Can I ask why you can't close your door? 
That is kinda weird.... thought about moving out?
Cuddles are the most underrated thing in the world (in my personal opinion)
Could not agree more 
Today was my 21st birthday. Ironically I feel more like a child than ever before
Happy Birthday!! How are you going to celebrate?
Vent: I woke up early to do adulting papers but in the end nada. 
Went out on a Tinder date during the weekend.
Eight hours over coffee???
I know right? It's just crazy. 
I hope you drank it before it got cold
cold hot coffee is the worst

Cakes are nice. I would buy you a cake if I could.

My dinner guests cancelled on me and I'm trying to be cool about it. (Venting)
Australian here. Can I come over for bbq?
Fuck yeah. Can you bring kangaroo meat? I want to try it. 
One thing that sucks about being single: you are constantly being reminded of it
When people say to me that oh, you're single,  I say Thank God.  
Then when you do get a significant other people pester you about having kids. I'm good, thanks.
I‚Äôm really sad, what can I do?
I find stand up comedy to be helpful. Netflix has a bunch so does Apple Music and youtube.

I don‚Äôt really consider myself extremely attractive but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ugly 
5,7 
If you were going to die tomorrow, what would you make your last meal be?
Honestly, I'd keep it simple. Just tacos. Specifically, tacos de lengua 
No limit or budget? Everything.
you would probably die before your deadline then...
That's the plan
Probably a really good burger. 
v good choice. med rare or?
good quality steak
i dont actually really like steak... :O
I'd have a pizza and lasagna :') and marshmallows
Does anyone want bad advice?
r/shitttylifeprotips
Unconventional uses for IKEA furniture?
I hear tables are good for eating on, couches for sitting, and TV stands for TVs. 
My shoulders hurt.  How should I make them feel better?
Rub some dirt on them and quit complaining. 
But I just showered!  I don't want to get dirty. 
What should I do about my crippling fear of spiders?
Buy a iguana, name her Stan. Train Stan to eat üï∑ 
Damn it, I thought this was *bad* advice!
Hahaha you seem like a fun guy(or girl) to hang with.
On the contrary. I'm pretty boring and have very few friends.
&gt; I'm pretty boring and have very few friends.
So you are like me.
Where are you right now and what are you doing?
At a fire station in northeast florida, about to finish some reports.
It's a rainy Saturday night and I'm in the mood to chat.
If you could have any superpower you wanted would you choose boxers or briefs?
Hmmmm. Well, since I am a female, I'm going to say briefs. What about you? 
I finally told the guy I had a crush on, that I like him.
Good for you! I wish I started doing this when I was younger. 
Thankyou! I'm really pleased 
Here is a space you missed !
A poor attempt, not even angry just disappointed.
I am really happy for you. Go girl for him and ride on him like a cowgirl. ;P
99% of men will respect you for it. Even if they do not reciprocate the same feelings.
in the age of #metoo that's the way its probably going to have to be. 
Ugh shut up 
I am curious to find out why you were rejected.
What's your Myers Briggs type?
INFP...I've taken it many times over the years and it's never changed 
I don't like Snapchat because I can't remember the conversation I was having with a friend hours earlier.
Do you know that you can save all text messages in the chat?
Your mistake is trying to use Snapchat for something other than sending nudes
Snapchat is such a drag anymore. I hate the new update as well. 
I have a question about Feb 14; for those both in, and NOT in relationships.
I didn't even know Valentine's Day was coming up. (That should answer your question)
I just realized 'Black Panther' is a superhero movie, not a historical drama about the '60s Black Panther organization.
I realized last week that Lady Bird was not about LBJ's wife.
Really? Why would they call it that then? 
The main character is called Lady Bird. 
R/outoftheloop
/r/OutOfTheLoop 
Honestly the soundtrack for Black Panther is looking to be straight up üî•üî•üî•!!!
I'll keep my ears peeled for it! I *was* pumped for a '60s and '70s funk soundtrack. 
##NO MORE COMIC BOOK MOVIES
Nah, Comic Book movies are great. 
Well the Marvel ones anyway. 
I feel like they're tired and oversaturated at this point. 
Holy shit I didn't know that either
Tomorrow I'm going to a concert, and a very cute girl I've wanted to talk to for a long time is going too. Wish me luck, guys.
Wear protection! 
A night out can ruin your ears for life!

I thought that was chronic masterbation? 
I just don't understand the 'sexy woman' desktop wallpapers...

Solid black wallpaper.

Mine was yesterday, hit 11 years. 
Holy shit! Were you a Digg refugee?

In the last 7 days I've killed over 10-15 fruit flies.
My 16 yr old got back from the Apple Store earlier today and told me he caught someone trying to steal..

They aren't forcing anyone to buy their shit!
Why an witness

Highlight of the weekend?
I went to the mall. It was pretty fun.
Lol did you buy things or just walked around? :p 
Exams were over for the time being so I got piss drunk on Saturday. It was fun. 
I ought to get piss drunk at some point
Get on it. 
Nah, I‚Äôd rather spend the money on something a bit more... special, yet highly taboo.
Like what?! 
An escort, a classy one who works for herself and herself alone.
Lol good luck.. I don't even know how you would go about finding that! 
Me neither. Not that I'd ever be able to afford such a person if I did find one.
How do I ask someone their name when they already know me by name.
I apologize that I suck at remembering names.  What's yours again?
Hahaha...that's my case..it really sucks...what's urs....
How do you ask that question for the 5th time?
Sorry what's your name?
when they look at you confused say:
I mean your last name
Ask him how to spell it
Trawl through the friends list of a mutual friend on Facebook? 
What if you don't get time
Then how much are you bothered?
What if you just come across someone..
I just ask, 'what the fuck is your name again?'  I have to do it a lot at work. 
Yeah but it feels bad..
So? If you want to know, it's what you gotta do. 
I take a risk and say how do you spell your name (again)?
Risky at times like in my case
So how do you spell your name?
Uh...T-i-m?
Hahaha no your last name!
yes! tuesday: the q's day!
1. Come on Eileen
2. Definitely ;)

My mom says I'm handsome.
Funny, she told me the same thing. 
I got called a noob on xbox live today
I love getting called a hacker. It's such a nice compliment.
I was lagging bro. That's all it was.
I speak english everyday on the Internet, but I can't actually speak english
Can you understand spoken english?
Want to practice?
I can read french ok, but speaking it? Tabernac.
Something I would tell anyone... But I've imagined a world and different life for 2 years now. Has anyone had any fantasy's really long?
Mine has been going on for about 13 years...
Happy to meet a like-minded individual.  Honestly.
Hey, you, yes-yes, you..
Woah?!! It‚Äôs just that easy? Fuck off.

What brought you to Reddit?
Pewdiepie submissions, if you watch his videos?
I don‚Äôt think I have! Should I?

We're alike. I try to have black-colored possessions. 
What was the last song you listened to just minutes ago?
Yeah! - Usher
I haven‚Äôt gotten sick since December 2011. That is 6 years and 1 month of not even catching a cold.

It is my birthday today :)
Happy birthday! &lt;3 Mine is coming soon too. Got any plans for the day?
Feliz cumplea√±os :)
Hey my beautiful people! how's you're night going?
At the moment I'm bored at work. Could always be worse. At least I'm getting paid. 
Where do you work? What do you do? 
Valentines Day plans?
Probably like every other year, won't notice it's here until it's gone.
What a wistful sentence haha 
Kung fu Panda saved my life.
I love this post a lot. Depression is a bitch, thats why I'm back in therapy. 
Ugh, thinkin bout going back to therapy myself:)
My new therapist is amazing and wonderful. Find the right person.
The power of allowing Jack Black into your life.
This is not, the greatest post in the wor-orrld, this is just a tribute.

I don't need to vent but it's awesome you made this offer. Thank you! 
I'm having a good day today, can I take a to-go order?
Good! :) And what would you like?
Any fun weekend plans?

Oh how cool is that! Where are you traveling from? And are you traveling for work or pleasure? 
Just the beach I guess. Not that fun but definitely beautiful

I was hoping you could be more specific? :)
Lonely person in need of a conversation so anyone wanna have a conversation about anything?
I would talk to you but my computer is dead and my charger is missing :(
Do you still need to chat?!
I gave my crush a birthday present and she loved it.
Ask. Them. Out.
Judging by all the responses I have to now lol.
dick in a box?
Wanted to at first but I couldn't find a box big enough, unfortunantely. :(
Goodluck! I had the same issue, 4 years strong at 16. You will be fine if shes as you say.
So friendzoned then?
I hope not. I will try to not get into it in the first place.
Wish it happened with me!

I have a date! I am excited.
And a little nervous.
Every time I go home by train I am followed by older man, it is getting really weird
Maybe you remind him of someone.
But is all this necessary because of that?
Nope. He sounds like a creep. You could say hi to him and tell us how he reacted.
I am afraid that he would think that I am interested in him and it would get only worse
Just tell him, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want? You‚Äôre bothering me and in my space.‚Äù
I am too polite for something like this, but even I have my limits
Say it in a joking like casual angry tone. Not a true angry tone. 
The way he knocked on my window, damn...
OP, please update us when you can. Honestly worried :(
Everything is fine, thank you for your concerns.
r/LetsNotMeet
Fwiw, stay safe OP. This story kind of freaked me out :(
That knock on the window freaked me too

Just found out how accepting of other people's hobbies I am.
Model trains. Hell yeah.

Say hi and I'll tell you what I find cool about you.
Hey there! 
I just had vocal cord surgery and I'm not allowed to make any noise for one week. I now realize how hard it is to not laugh...I feel like I'm Jimmy Fallon on a SNL sketch trying not to break.
Aww that's so sad :(, how is your throat though?
&gt; A/S/L? 
How did you reach 400 karma?
You made it! Congratulations!
I had this post about armored knuckles and it got me like 1000 I have ptsd from that night.
I feel like anything too popular would simultaneously put me on edge and have me wanting more.
Has a video game ever made you cry?
Well no, because I don't play video games, I've no time for that nonsense.
Hey, I love you.
Thank you, I love me too.

No worries! Thanks for your concern though! 
Congrats! I imagine it was a bit of rules 1 &amp; 2, but hope it works out
Obviously it was rule 1&amp;2 but who cares? 
That's so nice, I've always wanted to kiss a stranger
Omg thats so great. Im 29 and never had one of those :/
Aww! So sweet. Now I can‚Äôt stop smiling :)

You don‚Äôt agree? üòï
My puppy died and I just kind of want someone to talk to.
I'm sorry for your loss :(
My mom uses the word fetish in place of the word pet peeve. At this point it's too late to correct her. What is a word your parents have used that makes you think, uh that's the wrong word?
Oh man. You should correct her so she doesn‚Äôt embarrass herself in front of others. D:

Come on man, how have you not corrected her yet
Embarrassing myself in front of others is my number one fetish

Yeah hopefully I'll do some home recording thing for it this week!
Could you send me the link via pm when you publish it? I‚Äôm curious 
Can I have a do-over?

What makes you proud of yourself right now?
I'm studying. And drinking a blueberry smoothie that I made. What a day. 
I yearn for this type of go getter mentality
Not much. Pretty bloody miserable about most things, at the minute.
I'm not even sure.
How's the studying going?
Studying? Oh.. of course. Evidently, it could be better.
I thought you were at uni?
I am, though I seemed to have forgotten for a short moment there.  
Haha. Easily enough done. Which course are you on?

Bigfoot is flat.
Excuse me??? Could you elaborate?
Given that bigfoot leaves footprints, which are 3-d - you are wrong. 
Those footprints were planted by the National Trust.
The National Trust wants to encourage visitors - Bigfoot is scary, this must be a conspiracy.
Bigfoot is scary, flat and scary, like a demented ironing board.
Black people are functioning members of society

Are you a musical enigma such as myself?
I just say rock since that's a wide net.
I miss the straight up Rock of the 90s.  Big Wreck is still going strong for the cause.

It would be my hoodie.  Time for a wash!
My friend likes to text me when she can't sleep
The real question is does she reply you when you text her when you aren't feeling sleepy?
I don't text her if I can't sleep. She has stayed up late to talk when I've needed it though 
 Does she have depression? Are you worried she will hurt herself? Otherwise, you are too nice.

Seafood garlic and cherry tomato pasta 
Care to spread the love?
People waiting excitedly for a package, whatcha waiting for?

Haha I was so surprised!! You moderate one of the best subreddits in the land &lt;3 
Why do you think it's one of the best subs? &lt;3
It's one of the most positive and accepting places I've been to on the internet
Guess you could say that's a plus XD
Definitely üòéüòé
So how's your night been treating you?
Pretty good! Yours?
Ups and downs, rocking the night owl lifestyle

As convenient as it is, it‚Äôs been done to death already, sorry
Lol I don't want you to win. I'm doing the same contest ;)
Let‚Äôs talk about Nirvana?
eh
They certainly were popular but they were not my favorite grunge band from the 90s.
There shouldn't be a question mark in your title.
It‚Äôs too late! I can‚Äôt change it!
I like lithium 
It‚Äôs really good! Probably one of my favorites!
I want to start a new hobby, have any ideas?
Sounds like someone wants to get to bitcoin 
What do you mean? 
It's my first Reddit birthday today.

What's your favourite movie? I know you've gone to bed but I want to know if that's okay.
I'm thinking of deleting the Reddit app
I found my QoL has improved the more I distance myself from social media and websites.
Unemployed for a month starting to feel hopeless and really down. Just got two calls for interviews out of nowhere. Had to tell someone!
good for you OP, been unemployed from almost a year and I'm planning to kill myself
Best of luck!
Remember to under promise and over deliver when you start off :)
Thank you! I really appreciate it! Some great advice there. 
I‚Äôm 33 and I‚Äôve just passed my driving test!
Congratulations on passing your test! Was it your first try?
No, it was my third! Ha. Maybe that‚Äôs why I was extra relieved 
it took me four times to pass my written! i feel this. 
Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself for accomplishing this! :D
I would throw a mini party honestly 
I just peed my pants, how‚Äôs your Monday going so far?
peeing your pants is cool
I feel slightly less than cool right now. 
Well, I just found out that I no longer have 20/20 vision, but doctor said it's only minimal
Going good, got a day off from work and gonna head out to do some shopping.
Nothing better than having a Monday off from work! Good for you. 
Yep, but now we got a ice rain/snow mix hitting us right now :(

I feel as though I have no connection on to my family anymore. 
Im at home waiting for a robber

Sounds interesting. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll try it though, it just sounds so weird.
What's weird about having a human body in bed? What's the difference?
What do you believe the afterlife is?
I'm in no rush to check it out.
Is anyone?
Looking for an internet friend that won't ask for nudes.
The only nudes I'm likely to talk about are noodles. 
Do you like noodles?
I LOVE noodles. Bowties are my favorite.
Oh snap. Those are definitely some fancy noods. 
I'm partial to shell myself. And fettuccine. 
I may dream big, but my college budget gets me easy mac.

I woke up the same. Except I had a weird nightmare. 
Let's talk about music
Not rap or R&amp;B, but you should check out The Click by AJR
Electronic music has so many sub-genres, so I find it hard to get into. 
2 years ago i moved 3 hours from home with nothing but a trash bag full of clothes and my dog.
You have heart.

I chickened out from doing a meetup
Another one-night stand, misses Cat?
Excuse me

It was for board games 
That sounds like fun. 
But I just showed up to eat at the restaurant but didn‚Äôt play :(
Hug. At least you got out of the house. Will they be there at the same time next week?

Breakfast at Tiffany's is pretty easy
I just finished Life is Strange...
life is strange ending wss still pretty shit.
How do you dress on your days off?
I don't 
I finally started being physically active again.
I think Cry by Sigma (feat. Take that) would be a good addition.
Hiya! This year I'm trying to be more social and talk to people more, so here I am. 
This is not a task for the faint of heart! Lol
No, but I need to get more comfortable with being social lol 
Currently laying in bed not able to sleep, so as always, browsing Reddit! 
What time zone are you in?
Central, you?
PST, the good ol' west coast
I‚Äôm bored at work and the clock seems to have stopped moving.  I really want to leave.  
What did you take for granted until you didn‚Äôt have it for awhile?
Money. I used to have a lot more of it and now I'm broke as fuck.
Damn, well luckily money is something you can make back. 
A friendship I had with someone. He passed away, never got the chance to make amends.
Online Calculators. 
Hahaha I totally get that one. The one on your phone didn‚Äôt cut it?

yes. 
Hahah no way! I am so sorry. At least you got to flex your excel muscles a bit.... eh?
Can u guys recommend me some shows/movies to watch on Netflix?
American Horror Story is pretty good.
Is this gonna scare the shit outta me or nah
Prolly not. It‚Äôs right at my tolerance level and I‚Äôm a giant P.
I feel the need to jam out. Good songs?
I personally like BZRK by Family Force 5 because the music video is downright golden.
Golden, you say? Will investigate :)
edit: you were right.
The power of love- Huey Lewis
You really will not regret it
Haha thank you!
No problem. I don‚Äôt know if you have heard it yet, but it is really good and upbeat. 
I have not heard it yet but I will!
Today‚Äôs my birthday and no one wished me a happy birthday. I feel kind of weird.
Nonetheless, there was a silver lining; you started this chain of giving :)
Happy lateish birthday my bro!
Sorry for being late, but HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my guy!
Let me guess, a Canadian ? Thank you :)
I get drunk and watch videos of luxury real estate to try imagine what it's like to be rich. Do you have any poor person hobbies?
I watch gaming videos, since I can't afford to buy a PC/console nor the video games
To get started with an entry level PC build isn't too bad at all. 
not when you're a first year univershity student 
It really wouldn't be. Save your booze money, build a PC. 
I dunno if this is a pro or a con, but being a Muslim, I have no booze money
It's an expression. Point is: it's affordable. 
I get the expression, believe me, where I'm from; it's not
I don't know where you come from.
I'll give you a clue, a country with a disabled president.
A lot of that going around. Any more specific hints?
The president didn't make a public speech since 2012, we call him the Invisible President.
Found out that my Uber rider rating is 4.68. I'm done giving out only 5 stars
Fuck Uber. Lyft is the way to go now!
Lyft is more expensive here :/
4.93. Denver though. I just bullshit with them and give out 5s or 4s if I felt unsafe 
Watch the episode Nosedive from Black Mirror on Netflix. You won't regret it.
I was gonna say y‚Äôall sound like black mirror lol
4.98. I wonder who gave me a 4.
Where exactly can you find your rating as a passenger?
Reminds me of a Black Mirror episode

Keep the ear buds out in public cause you'll miss out on more opportunities like this. 
Worst advice ever dude.
I'm seeing a movie by myself for the first time in my life. I'm already loving it!
My bad social anxiety pushes me to watch movies alone and avoid friends. 
What's something you can't not spend money on eeevvveeeennn if you shouldn't...
Ahhhhh double negatives.
Books and food :) I love them both so much that I just can't help myself

LOUDER PLZ.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU WITH THE VOICE CAN YOU TYPE LOUDER PLZ
Currently paralyzed by allergies. 
OMG dude this is the worst. RIP me. 
What do you need?
I need someone to hug.
Or a beer 
I need to make decisions. 
Hmm... have you considered a Magic 8 ball?
Nah, I don't want to be remembered as used a magic 8 ball to decide whether to keep going. 
A friend

We need gas too....and no exits as far as the eye can see
I said **DON'T** go making me worry! 
A question about ‚Äòbucket lists‚Äô
Is it a list if it's one thing? What the hell is that? A Bucket task?
A work in progress :)
No. It's done. It's the only thing that will ever be on the list. It's a list of one.
A fulfilled life?
I am a simple man. It might be fulfilment.

Anyone else get stupid happy when someone is remotely nice to you?

I'm still searching for mine
Me too man
I'm a girlüòÇ
I use man and dude as gender neutral pronouns
Oh ok my bad
Do you like yourself?
I don't like myself at all.
You will eventually!  You‚Äôll look back and see how far you‚Äôve come 
I wish I could still believe that. 
Reddit's April Fools have started, Join our r/CircleOfTrust
Yes. MUAHAHAHA. 
@tizorres can you make another one?
Unfortunately only one per user. Unless another mod wants to give it a try

Please do
In What Respects Are You Still The Same Person You Were As A Child?

How have you been lately?
I am falling apart. I'm really struggling to keep going. 
Same here. What are you up to?
I'm about to go to bed, I've got to get up early tomorrow. What about you?
I'm fucking bitter and angry
What‚Äôs got you upset, MSS?
What is MSS?
Not too bad. I'm in my final year of my degree and I'm ready to be done already! 
I'm trying to build a better life for myself. :)
I've been feeling down. I isolated myself in my room. On the edge of a mental breakdown.
What‚Äôs been getting you down?
Thank you older random man
Did the guy look like Morgan Freeman? Might explain a couple things 
Milk or cereal first?
Wouldn't the milk splash all over the place if you put cereal on top? Damnit now I'm hungry....
Exactly! Humans are strange creatures 
True true! I hear some even put the milk in before the bowl!    
Does anyone else feel like this?
sadly, too many of my days are like that.
Hang in there
Water is so damn good
The best water is the water in the glass next to my bed when I wake up hungover. 
Who else makes that little oop noise when you almost run into someone or almost drop something?
Canadians are known for Eh but Oop is probably far more common
TIL I might be Canadian
Sorry
i feel its more woop! from me. but very short and slightly high pitched for a man. 
Mine's a 'woomp!' going from low to a half-tone higher 
It's known as a Midwestern thing in the States 
Minnesotan here, I reference it as more of an ‚Äúope‚Äù rather than an oop (:
*almost run into someone* 
*In unison*: OHP 
Lemme just sneak past ya here.
 I always do this and I live in California 
This is definitely a California thing but more ohp than oop
Alone and drunk whats up
I wish I were drunk. I just got home from a long couple days with my family. 
Sounds like you might wanna get high
I don't really care. I might just end up going to sleep. What are you up to?
Taking a break from drinking for a bit gonna put a dip in just chillin on the couch
Cool beans bro. How was your day?
Standing alone in a packed bar. Waiting to find a convo to drop in on
Damn I couldn‚Äôt handle that hate being in crowds alone
DAE speak their internal dialogues out loud, to yourself when you're alone?
I have a Tulpa so does that count? r/Tulpas
Today I marched for what I believe in.
What do you believe in? What were you protesting? Why did you march?
Just caught two guys trying to break in my house ...
Damn. Where did this happen?
You got to get a gun. Could have at least shot one in the leg and called the police. 
I live in France and guns aren‚Äôt allowed 
This is why we have the Second Amendment. 
Yeah but I‚Äôm French

Life is Strange has an amazing soundtrack and a good story 
Fine I‚Äôll say it. The uncharted series.

Happy birthday! What games have you been playing?
Happy late birthday man 
Congratulations, /r/CasualConversation! You are Subreddit of the Day!
Aww yeahh 
Woopdedoop!
So anyways how is everyone doing? :)
We should talk about this... Casually.
I am a person who disappeared. I want to share my story with you.
Your writing is very pleasant to read. 
Very engaging. OP should consider writing a book. 
Sounds like you done right for you, but would you do it again?
Damn, guess I have to read all the Jack Reacher books again
It's deleted :( does anyone have the full post?
A girl said that she finds me attractive and my insecure ass thought it was a prank/joke .
tbh if someone told me that I wouldn't believe it either.
A dollar a shave isn't such a great deal
Screw shaving LOLZ...
I save a shit ton of money by growing a beard. And it‚Äôs awesome.
The chicks did it too!
I saw Black Panther and the most relatable character was the villain.
Also, he was super hot.
My mom just found out her dad isn't her dad by taking the ancestry dna test.
How's your grandpa taking this? 
Did your grandfather know? 
Two truths and a Lie
1) I graduated college in my Forties 
2) I live with a Narcissist
3) I've lost 100 lbs.
Hmm... let's go with #2. #2 being the like makes me feel good about the world
Then... I don't think you want to know the answer.
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
2 is the lie, because you look *fabulous*, dahling
1. I am bilingual
2. My favorite color is pink
3. I was born in Texas 
Favorite color is black?
1. I'm into fart porn
2. I'm a furry
3. I'm gay but still appreciate a female ass
What do you do when you are having a rough time?
Sleep or play video games.
Nice! Any specific games you really enjoy?
Skyrim
I learned a small (but sweet) thing about my BF that I want to share.
Fuck this makes me sad. Why do I have to appreciate what I have only after I‚Äôve lost it. 
My partner has spoken to me 8 times in 2018.
So being willing to drink a crappy cup of coffee so you can enjoy a good one is sweet?
He buys me carnivorous plants, bc he knows I love torturing bugs. 
What‚Äôs your favorite lyric of all time?
I'm thinking about it.
My girlfriend of 7 years split up with me &amp; I have no other friends online or irl. Can we talk about literally anything? I miss conversations
I‚Äôll be your friend! 
I finally deleted Facebook and Instagram for good.
How does one delete Facebook account?
What is your all time favourite video game?
Silent Hill 2
Great choice.  Why?
Ignoring skyrim as its too obvious, I'd go with darksiders 2 cos i played through it so much 
I played that game too! Really fun movement and combat. It's like low difficulty Dark Souls :D
It‚Äôs 'per se' not 'persay'/'per say'!
I dnot reaeyll udnesrtnad wtha yuo aer syanig.
/r/excgarated 
Where does it originate? Sounds Latin. 
It bugs me when people also use sike not realizing the word is psych like a psych-out.
Sike!
As someone who isn't a native speaker, Latin words in English really confuse me. 
For me it‚Äôs more of the pronunciations that get to me. Like epitome
You would kill me if you knew how I used to pronounce norepinephrine
I don‚Äôt know if I want to know.
nor-eh-pee-neh-freen
Norah Pine Frine?
Close..
Norah pine ah frine
This is heresy and not hearsay.
Both are good, they just don't mean the same thing. ;)
That and when people say ‚Äúwah-la‚Äù instead of ‚Äúvoil√†‚Äù...makes me cringe every time.
I see people also say 'noah fence' instead of 'no offence' lol 
No way... I refuse to believe anyone over the age of 10 can make this mistake.
Yeah, noah fence doesn't really hold water.
'Segway' bugs me. It's 'segue.' 
I fucking cringe when someone says ‚Äúhe did a complete 360‚Äù
Also er on the cautious side not air 
I think I'm bisexual.
That's great! It feels good to fully understand yourself :) Do you lean one way or another?

I was finally able to use something in real life that I learned on Reddit
Another good method is to use a broom. (Not being sarcastic) source: am a glassblower 
That‚Äôs called oblique lighting, and they use it to search crime scenes too! 
Be right back, going to shatter a whole bunch of glass on the floor and test this. 
Just a little glass will do, don't worry. Good luck 
Maaaaan, dont you wish you just had money? Like a whole pile of it.

Thanks for agreeing! 
I'm a grown man, but every now and then I put all of my strength into a Kamehameha blast, just to see if it's still impossible. What do you do that makes you still a kid?

I think I am addicted to Reddit.
Ugh, I know. My girlfriend gets mad at me but I'm hooked to that sweet, sweet karma.

When people down vote, instead of up vote, you get negative points/karma

Why not? It's the obvious thing to do.
Casual communication wanted

Why not? Is it not something you want?
Next step: touching a boob

If you put water on water, does it become wetter or remain equally wet
It's simply a higher volume of water
but does it become wetter?
If you put a solid on top of another solid does it become more solid?
What is the purpose of life? 
I feel empty
Why hon?
Can we talk weather in your area, pretty please?
It is night here and 16 c good I can sleep comfortably.
That sounds like a rather pleasant temp for overnight.   You must live somewhere quite warm.  
Ya India It is considered cool for us.
So my boyfriend moved in with me about 2 months ago
I wake up every morning with my dog staring at my face from 2 inches away. So, there's that.
That's like me, except with a cat's asshole. 
That's like me, except with a crushing sense of loneliness and the banality of existence.
You should get a whole cat, you'd feel better.
My fiancee broke her leg :(
Everyone dies in the end.
Does your boyfriend know you have a dick?
Pretty sure he figured that out
What's your favorite country other than your own?
Sweden
And why's that?
And why is that?*
smh my country is one of my least favorite.
Spain is probably my favorite.
That feeling when you don't see your own country in the comments :(
My girlfriend is on a date with my oldest son and I couldn't be happier!!!
The title makes t sounds like they are literally dating
I guess I kind of assumed people would get what I meant.
Dude this is reddit. People will hunt and skin you for a minor spelling mistake
Or break your hands? 
YOU FORGOT THE PERIOD AT THE END OF YOUR SENTENCE.  PREPARE YOUR ANUS.
You wrote in all capitals, and have no exclamation marks! Prepare your anus!
I still don't get it. What's OP trying to say?
His girlfriends and son are bonding 
Sexually
No they're bonding because they could become a mother and son 
Sexually.
whoah i thought you got cucked by your son..........
Ur happy your girlfriend is cheating on you with your son? üòú
Agony Uncle. Tell me your problems
My hand can't fit inside this Pringles can. 
Sometimes you just gotto let those hard to reach chips go.
But I've had my heart set on them for a whole 5 minutes. I can't just let them walk away.
Dear Agony Uncle, 
What is the best way to get out of an awkward situation?
My cat meows at me but protests when I cuddle her. Agony Uncle, impart on me some wisdom. 
That iddy biddy kitty kat wants a treat.
i need to do a homework and i don't know how :I

It's February 3rd and my Christmas decorations are still up.

Let's play a game!
OH MY GOOOOOOooD
The future has a plan, there is no fate in what you make for yourself
Listen, I know how to do some stuff, I will meet up with you, and I will kick your butt.
Taken? 
Don't think about it, Jake. It's the place where Chinese people live.
Lisa, what you are doing is utterly destroying me from the inside out!
AND YOU WILL KNOW! MY NAME IS THE L-O-R-D! when I lay vengeance upon thee
*pewpewpew*
For Fritos.
Let me introduce you to my best friend.
What TV series are you currently watching on Netflix?
Degrassi: Next Class
I'm also going to start the Santa Clarita Diet today.
I'm re-watching White Collar
I'm bored so here's a list of words and phrases that make me uncomfortable for some reason.
Wait, what is wrong with turnip?
Meatloaf. Ugh. Meat should not be a loaf I can't even try it. Just the word is so disgusting. 
Hey man you should give meatloaf a try. Pretty decent, especially with ketchup.
It's basically a burger but without the rest.
It's the loaf part that's the problem. That and the onions. 
Cool beans, thanks for the list!
So is the wifey preggers yet?
No but the hubby keeps wanting to have a kid. Turnip for what, right?!
Hubby got the Wifey Preggers with a kiddo, to whom they feed turnips every day. It's cool beans!
'meta', especially when it's said irl, I cringe almost every time.
fixins
tuh-TOO for tattoo, courtesy of Bob's Burgers
Have you ever heard an actual person say tuh-TOO?
Why do people hate the word 'moist' so much? I think it's actually a rather ... moist word!
Nitch instead of niche  
Tit-ular instead of titular   
Prota-gonist instead of protagonist  
I hate it when people say smoll instead of small irl, or any other meme for that matter.
Chicken boobs. Why? That's not funny. They're chicken breasts, and you're 23 not 14.
Ladybits 
Couch
There's more I just can't think right now.
You prefer the word sofa, huh?
Fondling.
I have a social obligation every Saturday until April
Any funerals on your schedule?
I Bought Pineapple Soap!
I don't notice the smell difference but I think I use old spice.
I fucking *love* Old Spice. 
I seem to have chosen wisely
Ask and tell me what your favorite anything is
My favourite tv show is Daredevil! What's yours? :)
Welp, I'm old...
I turned 30 today.
I blew my whole life up unexpectedly on Monday and it's gonna work out.
I'd love to just take off somewhere but I live with my partner and I'm scared of upsetting him. 
Relevant username!
Wanna make it happen?
Conspiracy charges here we come!! 
I'll bring the rope! 
I love all of your usernames. 
That is so awesome!  How quickly did you find a new place and new job?
Now that you're in San Diego, you gotta get into craft beer. I am up to suggest things for you.
Feel quite lonely tbh
What is your favorite kind of cookie?
The classic chocolate chip, never ever put raisins in my cookies ever

Any games you would recommend?
I just finished Life is Strange, that was a good game.
Doom 2016 as well.
I live in Switzerland and today is the annual siren test. Every emergency siren in the whole country runs for a couple of minutes
I believe most places in the US test their sirens on Wednesdays or Saturdays at noon.
Every Friday at 11 AM in my area.
First Tuesday of the month, ~10 or 11 am
Sounds like the perfect time to invade.
Mississippi here. The tornado sirens are tested every Wednesday at noon.

I like burnt popcorn. What's your unusual taste in food?
I like raw onions, they taste good.
So how are you going to spend the Valentines Day?
I'll probably play rocket league and try to not think about my friend
Whats there about your friend that you want to avoid thinking about?
I like her but the feelings aren't mutual.
Alone. Per the usual I suppose.
Hello I'm 19 and from the UK, I'm bored as shit and currently suffering from antidepressant withdrawals.
Mirtazapine is the shit
Fit or Muscular for cuddles
Not speaking from experience, but I guess the latter would be nicer.
I couldn't say, never cuddled before.
Time to experience the joy of cuddling with no sexual expectation.
Never cuddled.
Then go cuddle

Watching the new ghost busters with my hopefully soon to be SO
I haven't seen that one. I have way too many movies I haven't seen that I want to.
I should be asleep, but I'm here listening to music.
Why can't you sleep?
I'm really hung up on this corn in a cup thing. Why a cup, I guess is my question?
Cup because it's not as messy as eating corn on a stick. 
but what about bowls?
eating spaghetti-os from a can with my finger
How did that go? Aren't they slippery?
I just had a very nice cup of coffee with a very nice chocolate biscuit. 
Coffee sounds good right now. Well, I can't sleep so maybe it won't help me lol

It generally happens to be a book for most people.
After 15 years of wanting it done, I just made an appointment to have my hair dyed purple next week!!
I had a purple fauxhawk in college
When ever I see that I think Tumblr-Army uniform. 
A woman that goes to the same hair salon as I do is in her 70's and had her hair dyed purple!
Next Friday (8 days from now) I will have teeth again. I will eat a burger and chips for dinner. I am so excited.
Chips would be my go-to. Otherwise though, I would want to eat a nice apple.
Oh! And a pear!
Yes! Do you like pickles? Those can have a nice crunch
Adding that to my list! The hot ones are my favorite!
There are hot pickles?
Doritos. Spicy Nacho Doritos. 
I miss those. Allergies stop me from eating those. I will make nachos instead.
What's in them that you are allergic to?  Just curious. 
I happen to be eating rice crackers right now. Those are pretty good
I now had my braces for 4 days. Hate it. Need to keep them 1 year/ 1 and a half year more

I only pee in the shower when I'm alone. 
Really? I would've thought you'd pee on your wife when she's in there with you... 
I've done that, but it turned weird. 
I got slapped.
What did she say when you peed on her? 
There are two kinds of people in the world.
People who pee in the shower, and liars....
Agreed.
I do something even crazier. I pee in the shower and brush my teeth in it. It saves time.
Let's play a game?

I was dumb, why I said this? x)

People can change their socks as often as they want to, IMHO.  Not really worth arguing about. 
It's all in good fun.
How often does she change her socks?
I also would like to know this.
2-3 days, unless it gets smelly sooner.
Don't leave us hanging dude
Whenever the sick starts to smell. Which is usually every couple of days.
I told you that was weird. Also, now I know your reddit account.
Once they begin to smell, usually every 3 days or so.
Yum!
I do this weird thing in video games, curious if I'm alone.
I never once thought of it this way! That's hilarious!

I don't know what that is
Are you serious ?

Completely serious: What do people do that don't play video games?
Draw. 
Are you an art student or is it just something you picked up on your own?
I'm always fascinated by the cryptic usernames people select. Some are clever. Others are intensely personal and revealing. There's almost always a story behind them. What's the story behind your username?

Let's play a game! Tell me one sentence that you would say in your favourite hobby and I will tell you what hobby that is!
I like gripping large objects.
Maybe weightlifting? Rock climbing? Bouldering?
Are we paddle-turning vertically or horizontally?
Is this canoeing or something similar?
Not even close. 
The most fun I ever had was when I was doing Goldsprints while drunk.
Goldsprints.. Sounds like a quest in an RPG maybe?
Noooope.  Want a hint or do you want to keep guessing?
Hint, please.  
In a goldsprint, you take the idea of maintaining a cadence and throw it out the window.
Cadence? That's music I believe, so I'm gonna go with singing? 
Passive monitors are better than active monitors.
Hm.. Maybe a flight simulator or something?
Baseball is your hobby?
Which animal has always been your favorite, no matter what people say about them?
Penguins. They're hella cute.
Yes I said hella. 
I use it when needed.
I have many favorite animals, but I shops the Grizzly bear, because I look like one.
Better stay away from bear traps then
What are you?
I'm probably just defined by my hobbies.

What have you been reading lately?
Almost finished The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins 
Good Morning!
Good afternoon :) 
This sub doesn't feel casual anymore.
Everytime I post a topic to converse about, it is removed. Nothing casual about that.
lol casually removed. 
It feels like alcohol is overly prevalent in basically all social settings.
Tea over alcohol any day.
Hot Cocoa &gt; Tea all day.
Fight me. :P
What about chocolate tea?
I don't drink. This really annoys me. I am Aldo Asian. Alcohol could give me cancer.
Can we talk about disturbing movies?
Human centipede. Itll change your life
hahaha.....I don't know if I can handle that level of creepy.
I would probably call it cringey not creepy tbh.
Ah man you probably right. 
it tries to hard to be unsettling for it to actually unsettle
In a good way though. Not really, no ones ever walked away from it and gone solid 8 out of 10.
Schindler's List 
Green Inferno got me and my friends shouting most of the time lol it was kinda weird movie

Slept in , waiting two hours for for a haircut now
Nice nice
For some reason a really cute guy wants to go on a date with my fat ass this week and I don't know what to wear.
Do you know where you're going? 
My husband and I have always thought the other was waaaaaay out our leagues!  
I think I reached the lowest point of my life
They let girls win in chess now too?
Well I guess if they want their knight to take a queen that badly then they probably will.
Ironically, the situation was that their Knight was attacking my queen and I didn't want him to 
In a sense your opponent would be in a lower point in his life if he knew 
3 matches. Damn yes he would 
Chess.com ?
Lichess

Chess players aren't known for their skills in dealing with females

Women are just people with vaginas.  Don't put them on a pedestal. 
This one clearly doesn't understand the male mind.
The male mind isn't that complex. Woman are easy. Just treat them like you would treat a guy.
They all have boyfriends.

The z button on my computer doesnt work so I have to cut and paste the letter z by googling 'Australia Xoo' and using the correctly spelled search results for a z to use.
Maybe you can try the on-screen keyboard and click the letter when you need it.
Both seem just as inconvenient in some ways. Lucky its a xee and not a e i o ui.
that'll be xed if you don't mind 
Zed is a name, not a letter. 
You can hold down the alt key and type 122 on the number pad. 
To tag onto this, if you really want a Z key, you can remap a different seldom used key to Z.

That sounds awesome. It's a great place to explore. 
What movies or tv shows have you seen lately that you loved?
The HBO miniseries on John Adams was excellent. Just watched that randomly.

I'm going to my friend's house to play Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild!! I'm very excited.
Awesome! Is that on the new Nintendo console?
It is mind blowing that we have a robot on Planet Mars taking full HD pictures everyday, yet most people don't care about it. How can ANYONE not be astonished??

Big department stores. 
The first place i would go is the Lego store to buy the disney castle.
Same for me except replace castle with death star
My neighbour's a Lego fanatic, he got this and built it within a week. He must've have slept. xD
Must have have? Mustn't have?
He probably didn't sleep, is what I meant.
I could probably blow it all on a comic store carrying mtg alone. 
What's that? Is it a comic? Sounds like a card game. MTG Alone. Yeah, it does. 
Magic the gathering 
I'd leave the mall and have 1000 bucks in my pocket instead of feeling the need to spend.
You'd be bored out of your brain and hungry?
No, with a thousand bucks I could Uber anywhere I wanted to do or eat whatever I wanted.
You're not allowed out of the mall. You would Uber around the mall? xD
Can I buy one item from one store?

r/grilledcheese
Crepes.
/r/grilledcheese would like a word with you 
You know you have to have tomato soup with that, right?
*Why?*
You dip your sandwich in it. 
Because it's the *only* way to eat it. It's like pairing wine with your meal.
*I don't drink wine... I'm only 18.*
That's the legal drinking age here! 
What do you think the greatest pleasure in life is?

I wonder how many posts on Reddit are completely made up
All of them, including yours
Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.

999? Where are you?
Install cameras 
What color were the kids
Cameras are a good idea. And they were white.
Wow that is just shocking..
Why... Would it have been less shocking if they weren't white?
Statistics mostly.
Are you a racist?
Casual converversation. lol
I'm not sure I could let my cat outside unsupervised after that. I'd need closure of some kind.

Nothing new. Don't remember putting it there, can't imagine why it was.

What movie was it?
People have said that I look as young as 19. I'm 24.

Are you a guy or a girl?
I got carded to buy beer today.  I'm 44.  
Was the waiter fishing for tips? A friend once told me she does that all the time.

Coca-Cola vs Pepsi?
Water
Coke all the way. No one can convince me Pepsi is better. No one. 
Pepsi is better. 
Falling in love is a foreign concept to me. How do you know you are in love?
For me, it was when cheesy love songs started to make a lot more sense. 
When the thought of being without her was so horrible that it made me want to vomit. 
Nice try, cyborg.
Gotta love Saturday nights
I work saturdays till midnight :(
But at least you have fun :)

I need sarcasm in my life.  Someone who can give as well as they get. 
Someone who wants to share my hobbies with me.
My husband calls socks, underwear and the like small clothes and I think it's adorable.
This. Is. So. Fucking. Cute.
Has he recently read the Game of Thrones books? 
Or played Dragon Age?
Haha that's cute. The first thing that came to my mind after seeing this is 1984's newspeak
Haven't read 1984 yet, is it worth the read?
Holy fuckamole the girl I like actually said yes and I'm actually blown away
Nice, that's never happened In my 25 years of living üòê

Unpopular opinion - I prefer Oreo flavour things more than Oreos themselves.
How does it feel to be so wrong
Pretty good 
Oreo Cadbury dairy milk is amazing. Would eat over an Oreo. Also Oreo blizzards. 
Oreo blizzards are definitely better than oreos. Agreed.
One upping with royal oreo blizzards. Heaven. 
I honestly think royal blizzards are kinda dumb
Most of this post just makes me sad. Oreo everything! I even named my cat Oreo, lol!

Idk if it's weird but I am afraid of wasps, bees etc of all kind.

I remember every person I've kissed because it's only been 1 and I married her :)
I'm 26, and I can remember. It's only 6 people though. 
Like, romantically kissed? I do but that's mainly because I count that on one hand.

He acts on animal impulse, there's no why, only evolutionary reassurance

You play Bard?
I don't understand the question. But the answer is yes.

Did anyone else hate prom?
Didn't hate prom.
Promposals, however, can die in fire.
Thankfully promposals weren't really a big thing when I went to high school.
Same here! I graduated in 94. You either asked someone out or someone asked you out. Simple.
I deactivated my Facebook account.
I joined facebook when I was 17 and quit facebook when I was 18. That place is a hell hole.
A tad ironic considering the front page of Reddit, half the time.
Graduated college today and I still feel like there's an assignment I'm forgetting that's due tonight at 11:59.
I'm looking forward to that in a few months :)

Dont you just love coming online to an orange inbox?
For sure.
Indeed.
Indubitably.
Definitely.
Absolutely.
Guaranteed.
Certainly.
Unquestionably.
Verily.
Assuredly
Undoubtedly.
I get very excited when I see I have more than like three unread messages.
I wonder who is going to troll me today?  -- usually my first thought.  
I better get one after this.
Hope that helps :)
I do! It doesn't happen very often though 
I get a little anxious because I'm expecting a rude comment or reply. 
Always among the happiest moments of my day.
Anybody online??
Would you want to live forever?
Yes. I feel like it doesn't matter how long my life is, it'll never be enough.
Oh hell no, that sounds absolutely terrible.
[SFW] What are some of your more innocent romantic wishes?
Simply holding someone's hand, letting them know you're there and you're on their side. 
Being comfortable in nature, just the two of us. 
Forrests, Lake, mountaintop, I don't care. 
That sounds super fun
Slow dancing.  *sigh*  
Why the sigh? Are you lacking a partner?
My 11 year old son
&gt; In confidence
Ye ok
What a good kid. you should be so proud
How on Earth would an 11 year old know he's gay?
He likes dudes instead of girls
Hey guys, what are you drinking right now?
Good ol' water!
After downing a can of Monster. My dietary habits aren't great.
I've probably drank 3 gallons in the past two days.
Apple juice like a little kid.
Kava tea with some hazelnut creamer, sweetener, and cinnamon
What the hell are you drinking???? 
Black coffee, I am still at work trying to make it. 
Coffee! Trying to stay up to do a bit of studying. 
Fun useless facts?
So many. 
Give me a category!
Um. Butts. 
The horned helmet often misattributed to the vikings was actually used by the Celts!
Dinosaurs are pretty neat, aren't they?
ever heard of chaos theory?
Dinosaurs are super cool.  I wish we could figure out what they actually looked like.
What color were they? They could be any color and we will never know.
Right?  Were they gray or green and dull, or brightly colored, or spotted or striped.  
Would if they were bright pink?
My twin memorized every dinosaur species when he was 3, no joke. 
Well damn, now that's some real talent there.
Not really. Just the same beasts as we have now, but bigger. 
Prove it.
I'm a witch and I'm also bored

Adequate. What gets you tired?
Less than 5
I try and get about 6-8 hours, but lately i'm getting about 6.
Bananas are pretty great
Best healthy smoothie ingredient hands down
They go in every smoothie I make!
What do you usually pair with bananas in a smoothie? I usually go with strawberries.
And they are slightly radioactive, too. :D
Vsauce or Veritasium? :D Everything is slightly radioactive. 
I read somewhere you will die if you ate 10 million bananas at once. Pretty sweet ending imo
I'm slightly allergic to them, my throat itches/closes up a little when I eat them. Worth it!
Everyone likes bananas, I mean come on, they have APPEAL
yeah. watermelon is better though.
Do you get anxious when you receive calls/texts from unknown numbers??
I get really anxious when talking on the phone so I usually just text or email 
same here. i find myself only calling like businesses for appointments or my mom.
What's the best thing that's happened to you so far in 2017?
I'm getting 50 back in overpaid tax. ü§î
Well hot dog, it's like Christmas

Would anyone like to talk?
I'm kinda bored but I've got some things I should be doing. 
So, what's the weather like?
The weather is fine. It's soooo normal it's making me bored
What's normal? Hot, cold? Wet, dry? Why not go for a walk and try to find something new?
What does it mean to be kuaii?
Kauaii*
Kauai is an island that's a apart of the Hawaiian islands. I think your thinking of kawaii
Sure, I'm on class
What up
Sure man where you from? Replying from the great white north
I'm from upstate New York!
Who are you? Where are you?
Who here likes steak?
Steak is delicious but pizza is up there as well!
I'm in math class lol 
You could ask me any random question you think of
Yeah man, let's talk. What's goin' on?
You get an upvote! You get an upvote! Everybody gets an upvote!
Oprah, is that you? 
I've been found out!
So, uh...got any cars? :P 
I wish! üò´
Gave them all away, did you? ;) 
Can I get an upvote? Really need some of those :(
Gave you one!
I like to think I'm not a karma whore, but it isnt true.
Admitting it is the first step
Not to be greedy but while we're at it can I get some gold?
All I can give is an upvote. I has no gold.
Hi everyone. I heard they were giving away upvotes in here?
I am new in Reddit and I only have 1 post karma. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Really what?
we all get upvotes?
Everyone who comments on this thread at least lol.
Here to collect upvote.
I don't like upvote parties, have a downvote 
Have you ever gilded anyone before? You should try it 
Upvote me pls, OP! I got all of you as well. :)
You have a good day/night too! :)
Take care!
14 hours ago. Nooo, I'm too late for my free karma. 
Am I too late for the upvote party? Anyone? Hello?
What a nice thread you got going :)
Off school ill today, keep me company?
What's your funniest joke that isn't actually funny?
Are you really lucy? or you a 45 year old austic creep? (Op, not you Johan)
I'm Lucy. :) I try to avoid the 45yr olds tbh. 
truth
What do you wear to bed?
Just an old tshirt and my underwear.
Id feel tangled up if I wore a shirt to bed.
If I don't I kinda feel uncomfortable. No idea why though
Can I get a question?
*Hey, I'm ill, too! My head hurts and stuff...*        
     
*Also, truth.*
What is your opinion on pineapples on pizza?
My girlfriend threatens me with Arbys giftcards when I don't listen to her.
Try their roast beef. It's pretty tasty. 
I call it gray beef, and find it unpalatable. In fairness, I find all fast food to be crap.
Beef n cheddar is the way to go
We in the midwest call it pop. Sorry if you don't like what we call it here. 
I am in the Midwest and I refuse to adhere to your archaic standards!
I fuckin' love Arby's. Jamoca shakes.
What brings you joy in life ?
Tea as there's always new ones to try sort of all I've been into lately, not much else.
I fucking love bees
What's a stereotype about where you live that's actually true?
I'm from Minnesota and we really do say oop when we accidentally run into/touch someone.
Ah Minnesota, the Canada of the south. Is it as cold there as everyone says?

What do they taste like?!?!
Mines ok im having to cut like 8 pounds for my wrestling meet on Saturday

HEY! Peep my post history just bought some fire sneakers!
Favourite song atm?
Numb/Encore by Linkin Park feat Jay-Z
((Clear your mind here))
I will fold something. Like, on a post-it note. They come out tiny, like, 3 millimeters!
I am worried my friend doesn't like me and is only pretending to like me :(
You should ask them. That helped me.
I'm having constant panic attacks and it's driving me crazy. I want to cry 
Just got one of those new fidget spinners...
They look cool. I have one of those fidget cubes and I like that a lot. 
i was thinking about getting one of those too lol
They are cool. I like that I can play with it in my pocket without much notice. 
oh you must have either super big pockets or a little spinner lolol
They were actually made in the 90s, but ok. 
Did you ever got Reddit Gold?
Yes I have it now this is the second time I've gotten it.
Show us
How?
I've been gilded a lot, I also try to gild a lot 
somehow that fate escaped me for 3 years I'm here
Girls ask guys and guys ask girls!
Do girls/women take off their bras during physical exams?
Sure, girls of CC why don't any girls like me? Is it because I'm ugly? Boring? both? 
Why do you girls always look down or to the right when i catch you staring at me?
You find a genie that offers you 3 wishes
I can't believe that nobody is wishing for Peace &amp; Love &amp; Universal Understanding...
Clearly the reddit population doesn't include a lot of humanitarians of pagent models 
Just watched Guardian of The Galaxy 2
I hate the forced humor after a dramatic scene and I hate marvel and capeshit movies
It's not ripe. 
I loved the movie too. There was one joke that was way too forced though imo. 
Mind sharing which joke?
What's a career choice you remember considering as a kid?
Paleontologist, Archaeologist, Museum Curator, Ethologist, or a Biology Teacher

I went to Whole Foods and ended up getting Latin food and a brownie with an Oreo on it 
What kind of Latin food?
Tommy's 
What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word millenials?
I assume that whatever they're doing, they're making something worse (I'm Gen X).
Falcon
HAHAHAHAH THIS IS THE BEST COMMENT I'VE READ ‚ô° you have my respect. May the force be with us
Do you have a song that you're embarrassed to admit you like?
Iggy Azalea - Fancy
I'm 22 straight male and I'm fancy as fuck.

Let's make a story
three kittens went
to get some
Bowls of milk
But went missing
A rescue team
alsi went missing
This led to
another rescue team
who were equipped.
with metal gear
like toy gun.
and some snacks
being deployed to
the grocery store
where they found
three little kittens
who had poison
which went missing as well
but a seal
removed his mask
and revealed that
he was the pope
In love with
The happy music
That destroyed our
black hordes from
Pineapples deep underground 
That reveled they
were lizard people
who wanted to
Pet all the
carnivorous sea lions
and particle accelerators
Which in tern
Also went missing
However Bill Gates
was great at finding things. 
but also went
To a picnic
where he said 
Just press Ctrl + F
And then, voil√†
together with a dragon
That really enjoyed
eating vegetable momos.
They came across 
an intelligent wizard
Who told them 
'bout an island
Where they would find 
Lots of gold
Ted bought a
Present for his
Savage pet panther
But then disappeared.
The panther got worried
And began crying

Funny because I'm feeling like that too and it's only Tuesday TT.TT
I ended up going out for a few beers tonight, it'll balance out right?
Definitely, beer is pretty much a legit sleep substitute :P

Same. I'm a solid 4'11 
I'm like 4'11 1/2.  That half matters, I can round up.  
174cm. Convert it to your heathen units yourself, but I dare say (and hope) that I'm average.

Thanks for helping me do so!
It's nothing, son.

I thought Mormon and morbid were the same until I was 12. 
But a porcupine concubine could be a thing ya know ?
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A THING 
Maybe plethora you were getting confused with poinsettia?
I learnt relatively recently that Arkansas is not pronounced Ar-Kansas.

Do you enjoy it? Find it easy?
How to stay positive in such a negative world?

Guys, do you know what really hurts? Seeing the girl you like with her boyfriend.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
I think my wife looks super cute with her boyfriend. Makes me happy.
I'm a bit confused...
how the heck do you make friends in your 20s?
I'm 22, I'll be your friend!
Kind of realized that when my boyfriend is busy, I don't really have anyone to talk to
I wish i had a girl to talk to, Ditch the zero and get with me =o
No wonder girls don't like talking to you when you treat them like that.
I just had toe surgery and my dog almost broke my leg! Great times!
Oh gosh I'm so sorry. May I ask why you had toe surgery?
Condition I was born with. My toenails naturally grew outward into my toe. Not fun.
I just watched American Beauty for the first time. I feel lots of emotions now.
How old are you? 
If that movie blew your mind, I got a couple more you probably will like.

They're not even comparable. 
Wrappings with stuff in it. 
Tempura shrimp, man.
not my favorite, but it'll do! Fuck, I'm getting hungry now.
I ate sushi once, to impress a boy. It was gross. And i didn't get the boy.
ahh... you didn't have the good kind then
I have no idea what I was eating. Just that it was gross.
well, I'm sorry for your bad experience.
I know it's heathen but creamy avocado sushi is divine
hmmmm, what do you mean by creamy? 
oh just a properly ripe bit of avocado. it mixes strangely well with soy sauce/wasabi
lol well, I do love avocado so I'm sure I wouldn't be opposed to that!
I'm telling you it's worth a shot! it's become quite a fad among sushi places  here in Sweden
I would love to visit Sweden some day!
it's an alright place in my opinion. where are you from?
I'm from the US. Wish I wasn't right about now though. üôÉ

I love it when it rains
My favorite breakfast is pongal, it is a south Indian dish made with rice.

I realized I was officially an adult last night when I checked the weather to see if it was going to rain or if I needed to water my plants. &lt;_&lt;
Mine was taking my own garbage out. Fucked with my head a bit. 
You never took out the trash as a child?
Of course I did, but it was MY trash bin this time. Fucked with my head for a good 3 seconds. 
I used to play Harvest Moon on the SNES as a kid and this was me every (in-game) day.

How much was it?
I'd really rather not say right now.
I helped a little girl off of some rocks at the beach today and her mom didn‚Äôt freak out.
Thats nice to hear. I get your caution though, I tread lightly in these situations too.

It's to do with the number of upvotes/downvotes your comments and posts get.
Hmm. So what's the point of Karma in the first place?
You can't do anything with them, it's like getting likes on facebook

Wait, Fergie is still around?  
The Black Eyed Peas Fergie?
You realize she makes millions per year to sing, right? 
If I ever became a celebrity, first thing I would do is delete all my social media accounts.
Either that, or just hire people to deal with that shit
Get butters to do it
Not the best idea, you could just ignore comments tho
It's a perfectly fine idea.
No it's not, social media is very valuable for celebrities 
And yet people are famous without it.
The first thing your agent would do is stop you.
White knight cringe overload. 
The internet being too harsh? Impossible lol! 
Fergie??
Nope, sorry. :/

Well if you‚Äôd tell me where to get it, we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation, now would we!
Idk dude, like, Best Buy?
That means I actually have to get in my car and go somewhere...never mind. 
They married? If so that‚Äôs a big step :0

Texting quirks you like.
Never really thought about it...haha

\[lol I want karma as well\]
Comment section on r/watchpeopledie
What about them? I've always found it pretty interesting
True. Why are subs like r/watchpeopledie or r/wincest or even stuff like r/misogyny allowed?
/r/wincest is innocent; it is a isolated fetish with fake videos and photos.
Fake? It looks real TBH 
They get porn videos and slap captions into them
No shit
That's why I keep away from them, nothing really interesting happening there 
What's good in your life at the moment?
Did my civic duty and went for Jury duty yesterday, feeling pretty good about it!

Why am I always tired ?
Get some bloodwork done. Could be anemia, has those symptoms
Vitamin D deficiency. Believe me, it can wear you down.
What video games have you been playing last week?
I‚Äôve been playing too much breath of the wild.
That is one game I would like to play. It has a awesome world.
It‚Äôs a great game and if you have a switch you can play it while taking a dump.
Anyone up for a chat?

I'm encouraging insomnia
Not good friend, you need sleep
I'm currently obsessed with Bloodborne. Any video games you love as much as I love that one?

Just looking for some new friends!
Did you like Mafia 3?
What sort of rap do you like? Scat, fast, casual, heavy, or else?

People keep teasing me for cuddling with my mom.
My opinion. Y‚Äôall need some help. You and your mother. 
Because they show affection to each other? Must be a sad life you lead there.
I'll reply to every comment in this thread. Ask a question, muse about penguins, shit on Lebron, whatever's on your mind. You'll quit before I do.(lonely as hell)
Older than you probably.
&gt; In millimeters
Try converting the distance of the observable universe to millimeters. 
What‚Äôs the saddest song you can think of? Aside from the pet one 
Whats the pet one?
From those old pet shelter commercials. Arms of the angel i think is what it‚Äôs called. 
Cavs or Celtics in 7?
What's your favorite subreddit?
Maybe this one because the people are nice. You?
Probably r/AskReddit
I just learned about grilled cheese sandwich combined with tomato soup! I have no idea how I lived without that before!
It‚Äôs the ultimate comfort food combo, especially in the winter. 
Aww man I really wish I had discovered it in winter. 
Dip your sandwich in the soup.
it's just pizza at that point. 
No, once you dip it, it's technically a melt. 
it's cheese, bread, and a tomato sauce. it's pizza. 
The question is - do you use butter to make your grilled cheese, or mayo? 
Try adding a dill pickle!
This is adorable! Any dishes you think us Americas are missing out on?
Sprinkle some garlic salt on your bread before you grill your cheese... delish
My mom wont buy tomato soup so i cant try :(
What are your plans for the three day weekend?
I'm going to a music festival on sunday
Aww fun! What kind?
Anyone wanna chat
What's up? I'm just playing some Ghost Recon Wildlands right now. 
Never heard of that! Currently listening to the I music and drinking!
It's an open world stealth game, what music?
Sounds good! Uhm chart music unfortunately haha
Just hanging out at a coffee shop then heading home to have tea in my room
Favorite Mario title video game?
Mario Kart without a doubt
Mario FIFA (a.k.a, Super Mario Strikers)
Ha, I loved that game! Sucks that the sequel was cancelled.
&gt;Sucks that the sequel was cancelled
Isn't there one for the Wii though? 
There is but that isn‚Äôt a sequel. It‚Äôs more of a port. 
as a millennial, I'm frustrated
Avocado toast? Wtf is that?
How are you guys and gals doing tonight?
I feel restless and wide awake, at 3:35am... trying to depressurise but it‚Äôs not working.
What are you trying to depressurise with?
Just trying to breathe right now, clear the tension and all that fun stuff.
Try listening to some music.
That was what I tried first.
What music did you try listening to?
Video game soundtracks.
If you say I love you very often to someone you really love, it increases the chance of that being the last thing you ever say to them.

r/ShowerThoughts
Hello, what is everybody up to this morning?
Raining pretty hard outside, so I'm in for the day (I ride a bicycle; don't drive) 
I love the rain! Is it dangerous or just unpleasant to ride in the rain?
Not good for the bike.
Didn't even consider that one 
I wonder what we‚Äôd be doing right now if the internet didn‚Äôt exist
Probably actually working.
I would still be pooping.
We'd go back to our roots and become primitive cavemen
Why is everybody shouting :(
There is currently a sink dripping right next to me. It is driving me out of my mind. 
Have you tried hitting it with a hammer? That has been known to fix leaky taps
Unfortunately it is not my sink so I think I'd get in trouble if I hit it :/
Get a cloth and tie it around the end of it should help... 
You, good sir, are a genius. 
All good! 
Also last time I checked I'm a chick... or the world's first pregnant sir haha
Have you considered turning your hearing aid down?
Are people truly night owls?
I prefer the term superior internal clock. Mornings are for chumps 
Dang, that term makes a night owl like me feel like a badass
As the mod of /r/NightOwls it's my job to evangelize our awesomeness at every turn! 
I want to compliment you guys!!!üôÇ
Really wanna get in on this, but how do?
Throw out something! Anything!! lol üòä
I wrote a book. I'm afraid to let people see it.

I mean, that's a lot of trust.
I sent you a message! I would really appreciate it you could answer there 
What weird things are you interested in?
I watch Women's Wrestling from Japan.

I'm actually the opposite...I don't really care for writing but think I'm decent at it.
Didn't read the post did you? ;p
No I did. I never said I was the opposite of you, I'm the opposite of your post title.

Starting a new series on Netflix... 
Same as you, just beat God of War. Dat ending.
I love seeing everybody interact on here. When I see a thread of people joking around or uplifting eachother, I crack a huge smile.
This is by far one of the more pleasant parts of Reddit.
This really is the most wholesome subreddit. 
More than r/wholesomememes? lol
Absolutely! It's always nice to come here, just to escape some of the negativity.
The username and that comment make for an interesting pair, to say the least.
Maybe he just loses at being a loser, which in turn makes him a winner?
I am a female.

Living by a username I assume? Everything okay?
No, but nothing's really wrong either. 
Having a bed and a roof over my head.  I need a new bed though.

My 30 page final paper was due today. I had all semester to work on it, but I waited until yesterday to start it.

At the end of the day I'm just... Me. 
Is that a bad thing?
The worst. 
Well who do you wish to be?
I'm not really sure. Someone happy? Someone brave? Someone nice? Maybe just the opposite of me. 
Ok. So what do you think is stopping you from being that?
Honestly, I'm not really sure. My brain? Alcohol? My job? Your guess is as good as mine. 
A fierce, powerful, vibrant, but heavily faded red. 
You have to explain because I love the visual and red is my favorite color!!
Well I still have the vestiges of that fiery red but it's slowly being choked out by life.  
Oh...I hope it gets better!!
Thanks! Who knows, I might get that fresh coat of paint someday 
Is the absence of colour, a valid colour. If not, then I go with bright red.
I mean hey, that works. But why a lack of color?
I'm just not there, unnoticed, invisible, nothing of note about me.

I was indeed. Or at least planning to.
I had no idea that people actually brought food into the bathroom.  Ouch

Soup! Now, you have soup?
Is there more? 
What was the occasion for your bathtub indulgence? 
Stress and self-loathing.
Oh. Not very well. I thought it was Saturday :(
That was your breakfast?
It was gonna be. RIP.
5 second rule
I tried. It was too soggy.
So were you going to eat that special morning meal in the bath?! So much special here.
My sunday is over
E
I hope lessons have been learnt. What did you eat instead?
Bring empanadas, and get a disposal for the bath. 
I ate a depression brownie.
I don't even know what empanadas are! What am I missing?

My advice is to rent some new sisters before you settle on one, just to see which type you like.

I think they all sound dumb as hell, though.
Man all it needs is the R
The Tale of SCROTUS McBoogerballs
SCROTUS - So Called Ruler Of The United States
Hate it as much as GOAT.

SCOTUS sounds like a bad std
SCROTUS

Ah I can see where that could come. The movie made you seem like you were in it
No, I literally thought I was in it

Hot and geeky are two very different catigories that can overlap in many ways.

Idk man. All this cheese might make me feel constipated later on today.
Idk man, I think that's better than skipping breakfast :P
You say that, until it feels like your droppings are gonna come out the other way.
Good heavens. Go eat some fibre man XD
But that involves getting up.
You don't need to put on pants to eat fibre. If anything that makes it harder.
You got me there. I'm gonna fuck myself up a banana.
I usually have a protein shake but he was running late today and couldn't give me one!üòâ
Pasta, but like the kind for kids with fun shapes. No shame
Pokemon mac n cheese used to be my jam back in the day.

Favorite part of the day. I've got this awesome coffee that tastes like chocolate too
I just had some cereal at the hotel I work for

You know the wrapper is transparent right? You can see through it if you hold it up to a light. 
i had yogurt and a pear
Coffee and a cigarette. I don't really eat breakfast anymore, for IF and calorie counting. 
Had only toast and marmite because I had to rush put quick!

In Spanish it is also double-v. 
Kinda the same in all latin languages.
Not in portuguese.
As a German, you just blew my mind. 
what do you call it in german? v?
Yeah close its more like ve 
Probably has to do with V and U being the same letter in the original Latin alphabet.

Im too polite and now the Jehovahs Witnesses think I am very interested and have started showing up more and more and weirding me out
Learn to say no.
Yeah, youre right. I feel like im in too deep now but youre right.
Too deep? Please be careful, we do not want to have to do an intervention on you.
What are you guys excited for in the near future?
I have to go to the Netherlands for a couple of weeks for work. It should be interesting.

No. I will be working the whole time in a steel mill.
Brutal.

Living on your own is the best: dancing around with no pants on to music at 12.45am is so freeing
Pretty much everything is better with no pants on!
Best part of living on your own imo!
British pants or American pants? 
There‚Äôs a difference?!!?üò≥
British say pants for underpants/briefs and trousers for pants. 
Finding someone you can live with and still do this is even better 
It's 12:30AM.
I now know what I'm gonna do in 15 minutes
Either you don't live in an apartment, or you're my upstairs neighbor.
Rock out with your cock out.

Welcome! =D

A coworker just discovered my previous Reddit username and I had to delete my account. I was in the five-year club. And not I'm starting afresh.
That stinks.        
I, too, enjoy the privacy aspect of being somewhat anonymous. 
Haha, yeah, it does kinda stink. But I'm feeling positive about being a chocolate zen banana :) 
I just looked at your username - well done, you. 
Thank you! :D
We bananas must stick together!
God forbid we ever split! 
What if your coworker sees this post and knows this is your new name now?!?!

I am the only person in my immediate family who is sexually attracted to men

I got my 3 yr old to take her medicine. Lol. Trust me. Not easy
Am finally 100% over my ex and have recently been talking to a great and sweet girl. 
My husband just ran upstairs where I was writing an essay. He was holding a loaded bong and a loaded bubbler, which he set down on the table in front of me. He ripped off his pants and shirt and yelled, ‚ÄúSunday Funday motherfucker, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù
Honestly this could have gone one way or the other 
Yeah if my partner got in the way of my schooling it would be fucking over, and vice versa.

Hello random internet person
My problem is I'm a loser so no girl could ever like me. 
I'm listening to Spotify's All out 80's playlist and I'm loving every second of it!
Well I think we can all agree that the 80‚Äôs have the best music. 
I like 80s music, but for some reason I enjoy 60s and 70s music far more.
Try the 60s next man. Shits good.
Definitely. Got any specific songs/artists? Wait is Elvis from the 60's - 70's?
Making friends as an adult is hard.
Meetup!! Try it
Or a Reddit meetup
I'm 43 and I have 0 friends. Probably it's something that comes with the age
My bf is the best
What a lovely story this has made my day 
Sounds great!
i aspire to be like your boyfriend, can you send a pic of him for comparison ?
Lmao
Had someone. But didn't feel the same about her unluckily. Now I wish I did better back then. 
Had someone. She didn't feel the same about me :/
If you like it then you should put a ring on it. 
No seriously, it'll surprise him. Go for it.
ask him to marry you 
I‚Äôve gotten a few of these suggestions...I may do this. Hmmmm...

Congratulations on causing a shift in a real world world social dynamic. You should be proud.

Fascinating thing. 
I read your post 3 times before I realized you used the word world twice.
Why were you reading it so many times?
Thank you my dude! It was not at all intended, but it is super cool that it happened.
Why waste time, say lot *word* when *few word* do trick?
When me president, they see. They see.
Fight the power and put the TL;DR at the beginning.
The only problem with doing that is the whole comment becomes the TL;DR
This is supposed to be an ironic universe, so ...
a universe that does things just to be ironic?
Did I just walk into /r/worldbuilder
Still waiting for tl;dw to take off. 
Too long; didn't watch. 
You mean movie trailers?
How does it feel being a hero?
Not bad! I'm currently shopping for capes. 
I know what it means, but what does TL;FR stand for?
Probably just a typo of TL;DR? I've never seen that before. 
Oh yeah I meant tldr
What‚Äôs your guilty pleasure?
Some lorazepam and a cool beer. Then I binge watch old series while slowly dozing off. 
Early Britney Spears.

When I‚Äôm not with you I lose my mind 
I don't wanna say, it's way too embarrassing
I love that I can use reddit socially unlike other social media sites.
Be careful of echo chamber subreddits.
May I ask what echo chamber subreddits are? 
After sending out well over 1000 resumes in the last 3 years I finally have an interview!
That‚Äôs awesome!! Update us if you get the job!
I've been eating McDonald's for lunch for over a month straight.

Anyone else feels like making friends gets more and more awkward and difficult as time goes by?
You wanna try it at 50!

A southern coworker is trying to explain to the office that recycling is bad.
Oh wow. Is she also a flat earther? I‚Äôve never heard of someone who genuinely thinks that way. 
Well if her friend Becky said the earth is flat on Facebook, then by golly it must be true! /s
Oh noooooo. Thanks terrifying to know it‚Äôs possible to think like that üò©
People like this vote. That‚Äôs terrifying
That is scary. Also, reminder that these people have a vote in society!
What does the south have to do with this? That seems completely irrelevant.
Because that's where she's from?
As an undergraduate in a geology program, this is scary and slightly infuriating. 
I can here the ignorance in their southern drawl from here.
I hate answering where're you from?
where u from doe
So, where're you from?
You ever listen to a song 67,987 times before a lyric finally clicks in your brain?
Yeah whenever I‚Äôm listening to rap
Why do I still feel exhausted in thr morning even when I get enough sleep?
I feel the same, I find I do better when I have a more solid sleep routine.
I generally do have a solid sleep routine except for weekends.
Weekends always mess me up too 
Oh yeah. I will stay up late on a weekend if I'm awake enough to do so, and then sleep in.
Sometimes I wish video games were real
I wonder what Minecraft would be like in real life.

Don't light roaches on fire
How did lighting something with legs on fire seem like a good idea?
I may or may not have been high.
So you lit up two roaches that night?
Baby.
Is killing a living thing so cruelly a good idea?
Roaches need to die more than other things.

Do you think there are any celebrities on Reddit just blending in anonymously?
Oh, you can be almost certain of that. 
Right? Seems like they need Reddit more than I do. 
We do.
Kanye? Is that you?
That would be telling.
bo burnham mentioned in his AMA a few days ago that he lurks Reddit..
Everybody replying to this is probably a secret celebrity.
This post is my cover for this alt. Maybe. Maybe not. 
Probably would have saved Roseanne Barr's career.

Who likes the Beatles?
What do you think is their most underrated song?
For me, it'd have to be either Don't Let Me Down or Oh! Darling.
‚ÄúOh! Darling‚Äù is absolutely wonderful 
I also like Sun King. But honestly, I like everything the Beatles did. 
‚ÄúSun King‚Äù is so meditative. I love it!
I‚Äôm curious to know people‚Äôs favorite Beatles in order?
Ant man and the wasp.
Sadly, it didn't come to our cinemas yet.
Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is my number one favorite movie of all tine.  Incredible film.

HEARD of it??? Dude, sit down and watch it.
Man I have a whole list of classics I need to watch, AND MAN IS IT HUGE.
The Shining needs to be first.
Thank you, consider it done.

Didn't really think it's someone's favorite movie. 
It's mine.

The movie inside out made me cry, which is why I hate it.
I will admit it almost got to me when I first saw it. Some parts of it hit close to home. 
I got a job! My first out of college in office job! I'm moving a thousand miles in a week, and am apartment hunting right now. I couldn't be more excited and just wanted to share it!

Cuz?
I'm not your cousin...
If you're asking why, then because gravity.
*Only applies if you frame is not fitted to your ear or you got a really unpractical frame
Not true. Glasses slip - even the best fitted, lightest and tightest.

My mom is currently going off on my dad in Spanish. He bought and smoked/is smoking 200 slabs of ribs and a new smoker. It‚Äôs hilarious. My dad always goes way overboard with shit like this.

Nope sorry, I still have the same sausage as I‚Äôve always had. 
I fixed my car the other day and still don't have a sausage. Plz advise. 
I thought an orgasm was required to become a man
Chilling is the right word because it's below freezing here. 
It's not that bad here but still cold as hell.
Going to get my annual physical. Yup, getting finger banged in the butt by my doc. Good times
I've always secretly felt like I was in second place, not quite good enough. Until last night.
Wholesome as hell.

If you're reading this, I love you
So this is what love feels like!
You the real MVP OP!
I've been depressed for a few years, but this weekend I followed through on my self-promise to clean my house and told myself I'd clean my car today, and I DID. I'm not looking for validation, just wanted to say that it helps to accomplish small self-goals if anyone else is struggling.
Whoo!! You're awesome OP. You can do anything.
My neighbor keeps one-upping me and I don't know what to do! How would you repay a neighbor like this?
Graciously accept defeat and be happy to have such a great neighbor?

In Pulp Fiction, the Wolf was a really cool guy who drove very fast.
I want his 1991 Acura NSX so badly. It is so classy and perfect for a man like Mr. Wolf.

Yes to cuddle. 33M here. I want to be the small spoon every once in a while.
I just had one of those moments in life where everything seems perfect and I am completely happy
R/wholesome

I'm down for it. What do you wanna know?
What is a typical meal you would eat for dinner?
Such a cool idea! I don't know where to start, perhaps you could ask some questions? 
Does anyone like that weird, cosy, &amp; melancholic feeling of being happy-sad?
Happy? 
The feeling of Redbone-Childish Gambino? 
That‚Äôs why i (and many other people) love listening to sad songs so much.
I know you didn't mean it this way, but thanks for the chuckle. 
i get that feeling a lot but in the end the happiness fades and im just sad
Anyone else love the smell of cold air?
This this this! Even better when it's wet. 
I can only simply describe fresh cold air as *crispy*
Isn‚Äôt it weird how if you know someone‚Äôs username, you can basically summon them from across the internet?

Breakfast cereal that has the slogan ‚Äúthey‚Äôre magically delicious‚Äù
A sugary cereal.

Thanks for giving my grandpa laughs, Reddit
Much love to you and your family buddy. &lt;3

RHPS is a comedy first and foremost, so don't sweat that.
...I lost the game.
Let‚Äôs get vain
My face is nice to look at :)
My cat just woke me up by shoving a half dead lizard in my hand, and I've never felt more violated.
You should be PROUD!
I'm proud when he kills things that have invaded my home! He's not supposed to smuggle them in!!
He is showing YOU. Pet him. Make him feel like a WARRIOR!!!
The cat seeks better forms of entertainment than an open window.
‚ÄúWAKE UP HAIRLESS I MADE YOU BREAKFAST!‚Äù 
-your cat, probably.
Hairless!
Hey, at least it wasn't half a dead lizard...
my cat pissed on me this morning

Walking by a construction platform. I'm always on edge waiting for something to fall on me.

Exactly! I feel like that's just the way I'll go one day and my body knows it. 
That will be cool way to die! World's gonna remember it!

Yeah! Its like you gonna just die! Really weird stuff! 
I think I found the ultimate way to low-key piss off everyone around you.
Mildly curious why you enjoy pissing people off. 
If I'm being totally honest, I have the soul of a troll
This sounds petty. Are you doing it to better yourself or to somehow get back at everyone else? 
What were you doing when youtube crashed..?
I was playing Oblivion, the crash must have been and gone during my session.
it only lasted a couple hours. lol. guess i was one of the few ppl on youtube

Unless she‚Äôs just starting with the verb as a colloquialism.
Want me to come burn down your house after you jump off the roof?

Compared to the roach you got of pretty easy I would say !
Probably in the roaches eyes yes haha 
**Plot Twist**: That roach's name? John.
Gotta get rid of the whole foot now
My thoughts exactly. Amputation is nothing compared to what just occurred. 
Did any of it squish up between your toes?
I am sorry. 
Sincerely,
Someone who has an irrational fear of roaches.
Nothing irrational about it, roaches are gross!
Seriously dude? Go tell someone who cares

Apple juice 
apples have cyanide
Some oatmeal.
That orange HI-C drink McDonald's use to sell.
Listen I am still devastated about that. Why did they get rid of it??? Why???????
Chicken Nuggets! :D
I've mixed chocolate milk with alcohol before so it's not totally innocent. 
Add a bit of bailey's and suddenly it's a whole lot less innocent...
Just for fun.What is you pet peave?
People asking for my middle name...
People

The hype and legend actually make me cry happy tears 
Anything by Glass Animals!
Flogging Molly - Drunken Lullabies.
The song or the whole album. 
I really like this, It makes me want to learn how to do a jig and get drunk.
Just one song that I always like hearing: Uncontrollable Urge by Devo
I started dancing like crazy when I first heard this song. Thank you I‚Äôve found my anthem.
Also, if you're still looking for music, Genius by C2C. Different but still good.

I'D looove some beads!.....

Oh yeah that's what they call me.
The real question is why did you ps4block your brother?
He actually said to me after receiving the hoverboard that he likes it more than the PS4!
Damn shame you got blocked. You could've tried to sell her some nudes.
I‚Äôve blown more air than usual through my nose after reading it. So here, have my upvote
OP snapped 
How long before he lost interest in the hoverboard? lol 
I got a sofa. Free, but you gotta come pick it up.

Anyone else feel starved of affection?
I crave hugs, sometimes it‚Äôs the medicine that I want when I‚Äôm feeling down 
Everyday of this cold life in this unforgiving world.
So what's going wrong in your life?
A type of loneliness and a lack of banana milkshake.

I miss dominos bread bowl pasta. (I‚Äôm out of the country) So gooood.

Yet you're on Reddit ü§î
Yeah but we don't know who any of these fucking people are lol
Does anyone else not enjoy being around or hanging out with people, but at the same time are incredibly lonely and want to be around people.
Probably on autistic spectrum
Guaranteed on autism spectrum. It‚Äôs a spectrum, everyone‚Äôs on it

Silently crying in a McDonald's, got approached by a Grimace mascot.
Iglesia ni Cristo? It's pretty much a mafia organisation by now
/r/HumansBeingBros
I don't think Grimace is a human, though....

Grimace is fucking terrifying. Glad you're okay. 
I find him cute though. :( 
In a weird purple shit kind of way.

It's the best.

Comments are where the actual parties happen.
It truly is
In my opinion, a juvenile username is generally a good indicator of wittiness and erudition.
Hmmm
If you enjoy profound advice from odd usernames, might I suggest r/rimjobsteve

Bacon, lettuce, and pesto? That sounds interesting. Maybe I'll try it.
I work real hard at the poo poo factory.
I'm paying a lot more attention to usernames now. This entire thread has been gold lol

Have you ever gone kayaking?
Unfortunately no. I‚Äôm a scaredy-cat when it comes to matters related to water sports üòø

Gotta find myself a pool first!
There are shallow, slow rivers that can be kayaked on. 
Unfortunately, my word is Fired. Yes, I got fired from my job. 
A lady I don't know told me a joke on the elevator.

I'm really socially awkward in the first place
Your thoughts on men with their ears pierced ?
No. I will never alter my body. 
Why ? I've never had a conversation with someone sharing this opinion.
Because despite being an ugly mug I'll never hurt my precious body. No holes or tattoos. 
It looks good on some guys but personally I wouldn't do it .
Why wouldn't you ? 
Stood up for a girl on the train
You're brave. Thanks for doing that. You're a good guy
I‚Äôd hope he‚Äôd stand up for a guy too tho

Seeing three upvotes made me feel better lol sad but true thank you Reddit 
Cheers bud, Here's to hoping tomorrow won't be as awful as today. 
Odd coincidence ur user name is also my listless sisters name. 
Maybe you should teach her how to make a list someday. Then she won't be listless!!
I joined Reddit because I got sick of Tumblr
I enjoy tumblr from a distance at /r/tumblr
As somebody who loves funny Tumblr posts but got none of that on Tumblr itself, thanks for this!
Does anyone else like music that no one in your friend group is into?
I really like electric swing music. All my friends haaate it. It‚Äôs just so fun and catchy. 
My favourite musical genre is sea shanties.
I like music that no-one in my \*century\* is into.
I listen to witch house and electro and such... I never get to play music in my group of friends

Here. Have some karma :)
*street urchin voice* please sir, may I have some more? 
Let me log into my alt-accounts and see what I can do.
mine sucks too. but life taught me people don't care about me either way
Wanna talk about cringy usernames? Have you seen mine...
Eh, that's not too bad. Have you seen mine though? It's actually sounds stupid
I did the same thing! Still building karma as well, take an updooty.
I like your new username. I also like when people call them updoots. Wish I could updoot twice
So That‚Äôs what karma is for, aside from the butt pats, I always wondered 
Wait, subs have karma limits? 
What 
I make a new account every 6 months or so just to be safe. 
Sooo, is this your old account then?
here have some free karma
Does anyone else not really feel passionate about anything?
That's why religion can be such a good thing for some people, it gives you a sense of purpose.
Any Redditors interested in random day to day chat?
This is a lovely idea--i hope people get to make friends from it 
Sometimes I wish I could go back when I was 16. Phones weren‚Äôt as popular, my friends and I would ride around in bikes, and we would have to go to each others house to see if they were home to go out.
My phone's battery lasts 2 days.
Yeah, nobody contacts me either. 
Tell me something interesting about yourself.
What if I told you there's nothing interesting about me?  :(
If it was possible to overdose on tea, I'd have died  at age 13.

My favourite part of reddit is when a bot gives an answer like a measurement conversion and it says ‚ÄúI am a bot, downvote to delete.‚Äù And then people reply with ‚Äúgood bot‚Äù.

My son came out of school with his hair sticking out all crazy like a lion. When I asked him why, he said, I may or may not have tried to get away with mismatched socks in PE by being Albert Einstein.

She likes you

Rejection is better than regret
Damn she wanted to FUCK
Or she just did it out of politeness

You should've given her the drumstick then
Is she fat and ugly ?!
In Mali that's the same thing as a proposal of marriage. 
In Singapore I would have proposed marriage to her.

All those wasted years! But think of all the water you've saved. 
the water is not really lost actually. 
Am I the only one who does that on purpose (/knowingly) to save water? 
Put a bucket until the water is hot
Lol and then do what with the water? Cook? 
Wait, the water gets hot? 
Wait you can turn the shower...on?
Wait am I even real
I didn't want to be the one to tell you this but...you're a shower. 
Wait, there's water?
-- Flint, probably.
All you need now is a shower beer. 
I don‚Äôt blame you, this is fully parenting fail.  
im confused. how have you been taking your showers for the past 28 years before that day? 
Stepping into the shower and turning it on, getting blasted with cold water before it warms up

Well I guess shit do happen sometimes, but I hope you won't have to go through that!

I bet you're a real treat at family gatherings.
I bet you're a snotty ungrateful child. We can both play guessing games. 
To everyone else who is also alone on Christmas eve / Christmas day , it's ok. It's better than being with people who don't love you. We are strong and awesome and we can have a great time on our own !
Me, cat, jigsaw puzzle, toast and a boiled egg for dinner, same tomorrow. No complaints.

Your energy is contagious! Thanks, dude.

Have you considered therapy?
I only learned last year that the other side in the chicken crossing the road joke is death.
That Washington DC and Washington state were *probably* named after George Washington 
They could‚Äôve been based on George Washington Carver instead. Hmmmmm.....

Hot AC made me giggle 
can't blame you :v
Not wrong. Heat pumps basically just reverse the valve on the AC
Now I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre joking or not.
Heat pumps straight up do that. They're not super common though, AFAIK.
What would you say is more common than a heat pump? I‚Äôm dying to know.
Whyyyy does this comment have gold?
Why is your gold small?
Come to Canada if you can. It's a lot like America, but with nicer people and better food. 
Comcast doesn't exist in Mexico? I would hurry back there.
Don't fucking use them. 
I don't get how not having cable is so terrible
It's like. The Internet.
Your coca cola is way better hombre.
Yeah but they are also one of the rare countries even more obese than the US, for that reason
Mexican coke is better for sure, but they sell it in the U.S. too though...
This post is so weird. I'm from New Zealand and you couldn't pay me to live in the US. 
Reddit is the only platform I like these days. Reddit is honest.

Shout out to all the guys out there who are actually attracted to black girls

As is everyones skeleton.
Good on you friend. So fucking true.
Yeah, but I've never been attracted to someone because of their skeleton (; 
Asian males are the other undesirable demographic, so I feel your frustrations.

K pop fans want to know your location.
As a predominantly chinese-looking Asian male, I feel you.
lmao imagine being Indian

I feel ya
To be honest I don't really see many black people, quite rare here.
I'm an Australian and i'm 100% love black women - namely in the US. 
The title of this post would be pretty awful if written by anyone else than a black female. 
Thanks, unfortunately I'm in a place where there are very very few black girls around.. 
HK!
I have a weird, creepy fetish type thing for black girls! YOU'RE WELCOME.
Im attracted to women. Doesnt matter what color. If i think you look good then you look good
Can we also get a shoutout to all the girls who are actually interested in Indian guys.
All 6 of them? :(
i'm attracted to black girls! i am also a girl, so i don't know if i rly count here üòÖ
As an ugly person, I can confirm that the least desired demographic is actually ugly people
